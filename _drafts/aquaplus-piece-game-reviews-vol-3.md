If you've not yet read [my review of the P/ECE](/2021/08/19/aquaplus-piece-vs-panic-playdate/) hardware comparing it to Playdate, now is the time to catch up! It includes my 6 favourite games on the system. And there's [Volume 2 of game reviews](/2021/08/28/aquaplus-piece-game-reviews-vol-2/).

There were a lot of games released on the system so I'll try to mention the best and most interesting by reviewing them in groups. This post details P/ECE versions of games originally created by the Japanese game development studio Mitchell Corp.

## Mitchell Corp remakes

In terms of quality vs quantity Mitchell Corp have a pretty good hit rate. They are probably best know for their Pang franchise, which has versions for most home computers and many consoles, although the original concept for that came from Hudson Soft.

> If you're yet to play the Pang series the Nintendo DS version is the best! And Mighty! Pang on arcade is next best. They're all good, in fact, but the formula was perfected over time. The modern remake is not by Mitchell Corp and doesn't adhere to any of the historic design.

It was such a lovely surprise to find not one but four remakes of games by Mitchell Corp whilst on my search through the long lost world of P/ECE.

### Chokkan Hitofude (直感ヒトフデ or Polarium), by Zurachu
Known as Polarium outside of Japan this game was a launch title for Nintendo DS. Perhaps more interestingly it had been in development for Game Boy Advance beforehand, and when it was shown to Nintendo they requested a DS version be made. The GBA version did eventually see a release, as Polarium Advance, and managed to trump the DS version by containing more content, game modes and tile types. You're spoiled for choice with ways to play this gem of a game.

On P/ECE it's an attractive port with a minimal front end that simply lists all available puzzles.

### Kono e-Taco (This Good Octopus), by Naoyuki Sawa

A strange arcade puzzle game that I used to own as a PCB. You control an octopus that can pick up and put down oil barrels, with the goal being to match three as the barrels. What sets this appart from other match-3 games is that the barrels are split across both sides of the screen, requiring a sort of multi-tasking approach to matching.

Originally I thought this was an unported game but there was a [Windows version made by Mitchell Corp](https://www.old-games.ru/game/11355.html) and distributed on [realArcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameHouse.

And now there's this portable version for P/ECE.

### Puzz Loop, by Naoyuki Sawa

The classic balls-on-a-spiral game is a tile-matching game with a difference. You have to insert balls into the spiral which, if left unmanaged, can become a wall in your way. This is the classic, clever, focussed game design Mitchell excelled at.

On second thoughts, this could be the game that Mitchell Corp are best known for, as it was famously (or should that be infamously?) cloned by PopCap Games as Zuma. There were other official versions released as Ballistic, Magnetica and Tokyo Crash Mobs.

### Suujin Taisen (数陣タイセン or Number Battle), by Naoyuki Sawa

The original Nintendo DS version of this game had a retail release only in Japan, with an abridged localised version appearing on the DSiWare Shop outside of Japan. It's a strange but perfectly-balanced game of number-sequencing, with modifiers and power-ups to ramp up the excitement. The rings system used in this game is detailed in [patent US8267761B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8267761).

I missed out on the online mode back in the day, but it's still possible to [play it online today using the Wiimmfi service](https://wiimmfi.de/stats/login/game/181). The original concept for this game was [prototyped on paper as a card game](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0706/p2/index.html) before being made into a video game.

This P/ECE port by [Naoyuki Sawa](https://www.piece-me.org) features his trademark attention to detail that gives it a very authentic look.

### More Mitchell Corp

If you've now got a taste for Mitchell Corp games, head over to their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Corporation#Games) to see a complete list of games made before their doors closed in 2012.

My favourites from the rest of their output:

- [Pang: Magical Michael](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5vTOyFjcM0) (Nintendo DS, 2010)
- [Mighty! Pang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goXjMzjcBU4) (Arcade, 2000)
- [Osman/Cannon Dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVMlC8uVjqU) (Arcade, 1996)
- [Chatan Yarakuu Shanku/The Karate Tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iUg62Nneus) (Arcade, 1992)

Last I heard, Mitchell Corp CEO Roy Ozaki was still open to licensing their game IPs outside of Japan. I'd love to see a more faithful new version of Pang, or a home version of [Gamshara](https://youtu.be/_d4IdPxmTtk?t=163), a game that is still not emulated.
