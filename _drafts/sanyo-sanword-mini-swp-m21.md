On my search for the earliest digital emoji, I posed a question that needed more investigation: what about word processors? The day after I published my blog post about the early emoji on the Sharp PA-8500 I started searching for emoji on word processors and immediately made a surprising discovery.

But first, let's talk about why word processors? It might seem odd to focus on this type of machine, which were never hugely popular in the West. But in Japan, they were more popular than PCs for around a decade from 1985 to around 1995 and the introduction of Windows 95.

There are a couple of reasons why they were popular. Firstly, it was very difficult to type the thousands of characters in the Japanese alphabets until the late 1970s when Toshiba invented a new way of typing Japanese that drastically increased the possible words-per-minute. But these devices were as big as a desk so could only be used in the office. Over the following handful of years the size of word processors would steadily decrease, in parallel to the size of computers. And then in 1984 everything changed: Fujitsu introduced the first truly portable, or personal, word processor in the OASYS Lite. This wasn't a huge success as it was very expensive. The real watershed moment came a year later, in 1985, when Casio released the HW-100 which started a battle of low priced personal word processors which drew parallels to the calculator wars of the previous decade. Sony would follow with the wonderful MSX-inspired HW-10 https://bouya.officew.jp/hw-30/ Toshiba the JW-R10, the first in the Rupo Series.

And it's here where things got interesting. Whilst searching for the Toshiba Rupo line of personal word processors I came across a tweet that was posted—by pure coincidence—the day after my "Emoji history" blog post had been published. The tweet mentioned Rupo and its typeface and how it had been used for a long time at Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line train stations. It quoted another tweet that showed four pages about word processing from the November 1987 issue of ラジオの製作 ("Radio Production"). One of the pages is dedicated to celebrating the posibilities of the new 48-pin printer heads, which allowed much higher resolotion characters. Right there on the page is a whole table of emoji, apparently from a Sanyo "sanword" personal word processor. On a neighbouring page we can also see a 1987 word processor connecting to a dial-up network to be able to communicate with other computers and users on services like [NIFTY-Serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niftyserve). So we can see how emoji could have been sent and received at this time.

I've not been able to track down precisely what sanword model that is from, but I have found some early emoji on the Sanyo SWP-M21 “sanword mini S” personal word processor from 1985.

I continued I found out about it from a tweet that was posted the day after my Emoji history blog post. The tweet was of a few pages in a magazine about Radios.
