My name is *Matt Sephton*. One interesting thing about me is that I prefer to write my first name in lower case, matt, for aesthetic reasons. I'm an independent video game developer, but that's just the tip of the iceberg that is my life and career.

This blog documents my various interests and I hope you find my posts interesting or enlightening.

## Epoch

I was born on 16th December 1976, in [Liverpool, United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool). This means I'll be {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 1976 }} this year. It also means I'm a [Scouser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouse). I still have a mild version of the same accent as the [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles), which is easily recognised by anybody from the UK and easily mistaken as Irish by anybody who is not.

## 1980s

My early years were filled with collecting toy cars and action figures, watching kids TV, taping music off the radio, following the music charts on [Top of the Pops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops) and [The Chart Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chart_Show), riding my [BMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puch#Puch_BMX), playing [Top Trumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Trumps), collecting wheel trims from classic cars, and chasing girls.

I consider my real awakening—enlightenment like a bolt from the blue—was an afternoon at my friend Rak's house in 1990, where I saw a [Super Famicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Famicom) (an early import from Japan) and an [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST). I distinctly remember the perspective change a the start of a race in [F-Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero_(video_game)) blowing my tiny little mind wide open, and then shortly afterwards seeing a graphical user interface and mouse for the first time rolled out a red carpet through the universe of my mind's eye, so vivid that I can still recall it today!

## 1990s

It was obvious to me that computers would change the world and that I would be using them for the rest of my life. Exactly what for I didn't quite know, but that seemed like an unimportant detail. My family got an [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) the following Christmas and my hobbies changed from cars and girls to computers and video games. I taught myself programming in [GFA BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFA_BASIC) with the help of [ST Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST_Format) computer magazine, design using bitmap graphics [Deluxe Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint#Atari_ST) and desktop publishing software [PageStream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageStream) and typing using word processor [Protext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protext_(Arnor)). After all this organic discovery and self-learning I did Computing as one of my A-levels, which was a walk in the park. At this point we traded in the Atari ST for a Windows PC, a sad but inevitable day, and I switched to writing software for Windows. [Apps of mine](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/archive/tektonix/) would be [featured on magazine CD-ROMs](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/archive/tektonix/featured.htm), as the internet was still in its early days and access was through dial-up.

From 1995 I studied Computer Science at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk), discovering the early internet through the [NCSA Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic) browser, learning HTML through view source, uploading my software to Tucows, searching using [WebCrawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCrawler) and [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista), and downloading software and files from the internet and loading them onto floppy disk using an [Apple Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)) in the printer room. This was the first Mac I'd seen and I was smitten. Whilst I was waiting for files to slowly copy across dozens of floppy disks, I would explore [System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7) and slowly realised why [The Macintosh Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Macintosh_Way) was so much better than the other computers I'd used until that point. During this time I continued to write software and games, wrote some guides that went up on [GameFAQs](https://www.gamefaqs.com), and tried to figure out how exactly I could have a career in computers. I decided it I would ride the wave of the internet.

## 2000s

Immediately after my final University exam, and even before my results, I moved to London to begin work at graphic design agency [Form](https://www.form.uk.com), who I'd discovered through their design credit on the back of [Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torn_(Natalie_Imbruglia)) CD single. That was a difficult place to work but a good bunch of people and a lot of star-studded events and meetings. Standout for me was meeting [Kylie Minogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue) and [Natalie Imbruglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Imbruglia) at the launch of a photo book by [Rankin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankin). At one point everybody at Form also had their portrait taken by Rankin. Crazy times. That was the start of a dozen years working in London. My second job was at a new media agency called [Blueberry](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/search/articles?KeyWords=blueberry.net), which was more like a social club than a job but we all did amazing work, work hard play hard, at least until the dot com bubble burst. To give you an idea of how crazy those days were, I was asked to work a weekend but I already had plans, so they asked me what it would take for me to work the weekend. At the time I wanted to buy a [classic FIAT 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_500#500_L_or_Lusso_(1968—1972)) car, so I told them the price of the car which was multiple thousands of pounds. And that's what I got paid for a weekend's work building a website that nobody else could get done in time. That car was a lot of fun, until it spontaneously ignited one day whilst I was driving along. The final ten years of my time in London were spent working at various internet-adjacent agencies, design, branding, advertising companies. I eventually worked from [a shared work space in Dalston](https://hirespace.com/Spaces/London/191103/Dalston-Roofpark/FH3/Pop-Up), until one day in bad weather it took me almost 3 hours to do my usual 30 minute overground train to Stroud Green. I could have walked it in less time. So in 2010 we decided to move out of London.

## 2010s

Days after getting married, in 2013, I got a call from a headhunter about a job at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/), where I ended up working as a [Technology Evangelist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattsephton/) for over 3 years. This was pretty cool as it involved some travelling, some really cool colleagues, and easy access to product discounts! The only down side was seeing behind the curtain and realising how things didn't really match up with the how I had known company from outside for the previous 20 years. So in 2016, just as quickly as I started to work there, I was no longer working there. We moved out of London again and I entered what I refer to as the wilderness years, where I was doing work but not really enjoying it. I saw the announcement of a handheld gaming device called [Playdate](https://play.date) and it seemed really attractive to me. I spent time getting back up to speed with 1-bit art, classic Macintosh graphics software, and more. Then when COVID lockdown hit the UK, I had just received an early Playdate Developer Preview unit. I had a bunch of extra free time so stayed up late most night making prototypes. It was the most fun I'd had "working" in about 20 years, so it felt natural to change my work focus to game development. I'd made games over the years, since 1990 for Atari ST and Windows/Mac, but it was never more than a hobby. With Playdate it could be a real living.

## 2020s

After lockdown I had created a body of work, of both games and art, which was enough for me to secure a shared space at a place called [Krowji](https://www.krowji.org.uk) in Cornwall. I worked there for a few months and did my best ever work. Everything was going great. Then in August 2022 I experienced a number of traumatic events in quick succession, mostly as a result of decisions made by other people on my behalf, and then some bad decisions of my own which made the whole thing worse. These have unfortunately left me with [Post-traumatic stress disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder) (PTSD), and dealing with it has brought numerous other things to light. And that's what I'm living, struggling with, since. It's not all bad as one of the games I made, [YOYOZO, in 2023 won a "Game of the Year" accolade](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/). So that was a nice diversion from PTSD, if only for a short time. In early-2024, whilst using an old pocket computer, [I randomly stumbled across the earliest digital emoji](/2024/05/10/emoji-history-the-missing-years/), which was a nice surprise.

## Old but gold

Before this blog my main web presence was the main domain [gingerbeardman.com](https://www.gingerbeardman.com) which is still up and contains a portfolio of sorts: lists of websites, app, projects, that I created over the years. My original web sites from 1996 are also [archived](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/archive/), including my old Windows and Atari software.

## History repeating

Every year I try to do a summary of blog posts from the past year, listing those that were most popular, most enduring, and my own personal favourites. I've also started doing playlists of my favourite music of the year, which I'll hopefully continue with.
