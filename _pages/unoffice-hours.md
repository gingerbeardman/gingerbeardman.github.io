Fancy a chat? I keep a few 30-minute slots most weeks—no agenda required, we'll figure it out.

- [**Book a slot**](https://calendar.app.google/GmZWHKfwUM7TajAU9)

Notes:
- I'm using Google Calendar & Meet for this
- [London time](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=5856195,5391959,5128581,2643743,100,658225,1850147,2158177&h=2643743&date=2026-1-3&sln=17-19&hf=1)—please check that works for you before booking
- I reserve the right to cancel/rearrange, but I'll give plenty of notice
- I'd appreciate it if you could do the same! I'll wait on the call for 5 minutes

Some topics people have discussed with me:

- Game design & development
- Creative process & workflows
- Software development & tools
- Mentoring & work ethic
- Architecture & design
- Music & video games
- Neurodiversity
