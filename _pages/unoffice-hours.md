Fancy a chat? I keep a few 30-minute slots most weeks—no agenda required, we'll figure it out.

- [**Book a slot**](https://calendar.app.google/GmZWHKfwUM7TajAU9)

Notes:
- I'm using Google Calendar & Meet for this
- [London time](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=2644210,2643743,0&h=2644210&hf=1)—please check that works for you before booking
- I reserve the right to cancel/rearrange, but I'll give plenty of notice
- I'd appreciate it if you could do the same! I'll wait on the call for 5 minutes

Some topics people have discussed with me:

- Game design & development
- Creative process & workflows
- Software development & tools
- Mentoring & work ethic
- Music & video games
- Any topics in my [blog posts](/tags)
- Life, the Universe and Everything
