The re-recorded version of "Ride on Time" (featuring an uncredited Heather Small on vocals) released in the UK on Deconstruction Records.

It was (re)made as the original samples couldn't be cleared. The track's success is what gave us _M&nbsp;People_, for better or worse. 😅  Sadly this version is the one you hear today on UK radio.

And here's the original version of "Ride on Time", released in Italy by the _real_ BLACK BOX in 1989.

## The Original Sample

This can be found today because the samples of the Salsoul Records classic, [Loleatta Holloway's "Love Sensation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddsO36srle0), were eventually (finally!) cleared in 2018!
