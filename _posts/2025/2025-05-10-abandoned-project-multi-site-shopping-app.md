I order weird old stuff from Japan a few times a year: old magazines, CD-ROMs, digital watches, strategy guides, video games, playing cards, books, artwork and any other old tat that takes my fancy. The way this is usually done is by ordering through a proxy service that receives the goods on your behalf and combines and ships them to you at your convenience.

There are many such proxy services, each with their own website and pros and cons. I grew tired of tabs from them all cluttering up my browser so I thought creating a bespoke app to manage them would be a nice idea. In September 2024 I built such an app as a rapid prototype called *Otaku!*

## Otaku!

The app itself is a customisable set of tabsâ€”one for each storefrontâ€”each containing a WebKit view, along with an editable list of search terms. So, you could easily do common searches and there was no need to repeatedly type searches terms into each site as they would be automatically be entered when you switch to the tab. Add to that Custom CSS to hide parts of the sites, Google Translate to view some sites in your native language rather than Japanese, currency converter, and several other useful related tools.

## Postmortem

It worked well, and I used it heavily for the duration of its development. My only criticism is that the specific design of the app and the unreliability of my naive WebKit implementation meant that whilst friction was removed by facilitating easier multi-site management, a different type of friction was introduced elsewhere in the user experience. A better solution would be somewhere in between, perhaps using a pover to switch between stores rather than the tab and navigation pairing.

SwiftUI is fun to work with, despite it throwing its hands up at several points and me having to revert to my last commit to get it back on track. I don't really enjoy building iOS and macOS apps at this point in time, so Xcode became a bit of a chore and took a lot of the fun out of the project.

After pushing several updates up to the [middle of October](/2025/04/15/when-playdate-stopped-being-fun/), i then let that final build expire and have never wanted to push any update or new version. EOF.
