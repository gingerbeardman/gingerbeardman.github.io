I neglected to blog about this in October 2024, so here it is now.

[Monokai Pro Vibrant](https://github.com/gingerbeardman/Monokai-Pro-Vibrant.novaextension/releases/) is my fork of the [unofficial Monokai Pro theme](https://github.com/keisto/Monokai-Pro.novaextension) for [Nova](https://nova.app) editor, by Tony Keiser.

My fork has a few quality of life changes:

- Theme Vibrancy is enabled, making focused and unfocused windows more distinguishable
- Colour tweaks improve contrast when highlighting found instances of search terms
- Comments are now *italicised*

I use the Spectrum variation of the them with the [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases/tag/%40ibm%2Fplex-mono%401.1.0) font to great effect.

## Monokai Pro

The original [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro) theme by Wimer Hazenberg is not free, so I would encourage you to buy a licence even if you're using an unofficial port or modification of the theme. It's only right to support software developers. You can get a licence to use Monokai Pro from the original creator: [monokai.pro](https://monokai.pro)

## Download

I filed a [PR for these changes](https://github.com/keisto/Monokai-Pro.novaextension/pull/9), but it has not yet been accepted. I'm not comfortable distributing this on the official extension gallery at this time. So grab it from GitHub:

[github.com/gingerbeardman/Monokai-Pro-Vibrant.novaextension/releases/](https://github.com/gingerbeardman/Monokai-Pro-Vibrant.novaextension/releases/)
