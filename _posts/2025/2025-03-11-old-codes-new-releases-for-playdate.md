As I sadly move away from game dev on Playdate, I've released a couple of interesting old things...

----

## NEW WORLD

This is an interactive music track where you're the DJ. You control various instruments and vocals, doing live mixing of the track.

It is a technology demo that was put together as part of a pitch for a game. Whilst the game never came to be, an improved version of this technology went on to be used in Bender 2: Bend Harder for the dynamic background patterns that animate to the beat of the music.

## SHARK TURTLE

This is a version of SameGame (さめがめ) originally released under the name CHAIN SHOT in 1985 by Kuniaki "Morisuke" Moribe for Fujitsu FM-8 home computer. The concept is as old as Tetris, perhaps even older, and at one time SameGame in its many guises was more popular than Tetris in Japan. One version had an active user-created content modding scene and some had strategy guide books.

It was submitted and rejected in the first wave of submissions to Playdate Catalog. At one point the plan was to wrap this in a theme/concept and give it the same sort of love that resulted in the great experiences of my other games like YOYOZO, Fore! Track, Bender 2: Bend Harder, but for one reason or another it never happened.

What is here is a solid "no frills" version of the game with solid gameplay and great music. It's a lot of fun and great to play when you have a moment, as you dictate the pace and progress of the game turn-by-turn.
