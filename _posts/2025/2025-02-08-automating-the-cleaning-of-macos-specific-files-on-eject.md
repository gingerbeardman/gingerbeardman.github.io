Dot underscore `._` and `.DS_Store` files are macOS-specific metadata cruft generated for foreign filesystems (like FAT32 or exFAT) that are not usually needed for disks that are mainly used on other platforms. Digital cameras, music players, e-book readers, and handheld gaming devices can get confused when they encounter these odd files during file system parsing and directory listing. The problem is compounded if the devices na√Øvely process files by looking only at the file extension as they will then see the dot underscore version of a file as a duplicate and try to preview/play/open it.

For years I've used an app called [CleanMyDrive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250208072547/https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac) to remove such files, but [it was discontinued in October 2023](https://macpaw.com/news/cleanmydrive-no-longer-developed). I continued to use it until it recently stopped working completely ...so I needed to find an alternative solution. There are some apps on the Mac App Store that look like they'll do the trick, but I don't really want to spend the time buying and trialling multiple apps to find one that fits my usage habits. I can make one! 

I already use an app called [xbar](https://xbarapp.com) for keeping track of my GitHub issues, itch.io sales, network/server status, and more. So I decided to flex my shell script muscles and put together an xbar script to do it. 

The script adds a menu bar item that allows you to:
- Eject (click)
- Unmount (option-click)
- Eject All (without cleaning, useful when you want to disconnect all drives from your computer)
- All with a handy notification

That's it! Straight to the point, no frills, functional software.
