I’ve decided to donate all of my [Playdate](https://play.date) earnings (my personal take-home, after [Panic](https://panic.com) and [payment processor](https://stripe.com) fees) to [The Cybersmile Foundation](https://www.cybersmile.org), starting July 2025.

> Cybersmile is a multi-award-winning nonprofit dedicated to digital wellbeing and combating all forms of cyberbullying and online abuse. It's registered as a charity in the UK and as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in the US.

Having experienced online abuse myself—[and received so little support that it ultimately drove me away from Playdate as a platform](/2025/04/15/when-playdate-stopped-being-fun/)—this feels like the most constructive and meaningful way to turn that experience into something positive. I’d love to donate the full amount these games generate, but I can only give what actually reaches me.

Be excellent to each other.

Peace and love,  
matt
