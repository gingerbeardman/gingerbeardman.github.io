After reaching [1 million files](/2025/03/28/macintosh-magazine-media-1-million-files/) in my [Macintosh Magazine Media project](/2021/10/30/macintosh-magazine-media/), I thought it would be cool to post about something I found recently in those discs. I get a real buzz rediscovering something like this after more than 30 years have passed.

It's a sweet little point and click adventure game for Classic Macintosh called "*Station: Travel Through the Four Seasons*" by Mitsuo Isaka, about taking train rides through the Japanese countryside. You meet and interact with a variety of people and explore each scene to figure out how to move on.

It was found on CD2 マルチメディアチャレンジ ’94 要賞作品篥 (Multimedia Challenge ’94 Award Winning Works) of [MACLIFE Special: Gokuraku Paradise Theater 1994](https://archive.org/details/gokuraku-paradise-theater-1994-10). You can download the ISO to explore that disc for yourself in an emulator or on a vintage Macintosh. I also uploaded [just the game to Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/station) so that you don't need to download the whole CD for just this game.

## Play it in your browser

But if you want to try it right now you can do so in your browser thanks to the Infinite Mac website, using this link: [KanjiTalk 7.5.3 with the Station disk image already mounted](https://infinitemac.org/1996/KanjiTalk%207.5.3?cdrom=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.macintoshgarden.org%2Fgames%2FStation.ds62.img)

The game is in Japanese and features mostly voiceover and a little on screen text. Google Translate can probably help with its conversation (audio) and camera (visual) translation modes. *Ganbare!*

## Introduction

In Japanese, it says:

> ここは“四季の里”といわれるとこる。昔から一両だけのディーゼル車がのんびりと走っているという。
>
> 駅は全部で四つの小さな鉄道だけれど不思議なことに、ひとつひとつの駅にそれぞれのきまった季節があるという。
>
> ぼくは、さっそくその鉄道に乗ってみようと春の季節をもっといわれる“桜ヶ丘”という駅を訪ねることにした・・・

Translated into English:

> This place is known as the 'Village of the Four Seasons'. A single diesel train has been running slowly and leisurely here for a long time.
> 
> There are four stations in total on this small railway, but strangely enough, each station has its own set season.
> 
> I decided to visit a station called ‘Sakuragaoka’, which is known more for its spring season, to try out the railway...
