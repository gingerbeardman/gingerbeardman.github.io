After reaching 1 million files in my [Macintosh Magazine Media project](/2021/10/30/macintosh-magazine-media/), I thought it would be cool to post about something I found recently in amongst the files. It's a real buzz to rediscover something like this after more 30 years.

It's a sweet little point and click adventure game for Classic Macintosh called "*Station: Travel Through the Four Seasons*" by Mitsuo Isaka, about taking train rides through the Japanese countryside. 

It was found on CD2 マルチメディアチャレンジ '94 要賞作品篥 (Multimedia Challenge '94 Award Winning Works) of [MACLIFE Special Edition: Gokuraku Paradise Theater 1994](https://archive.org/details/gokuraku-paradise-theater-1994-10). You can download the ISO to explore that disc for yourself in an emulator or on a vintage Macintosh.

But if you want to try it right now you can do so in your browser thanks to the Infinite Mac website, using this link: [KanjiTalk 7.5.3 with the Station disk image already mounted](https://infinitemac.org/1996/KanjiTalk%207.5.3?cdrom=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.macintoshgarden.org%2Fgames%2FStation.ds62.img)

The game is in Japanese and features mostly voiceover and a little on screen text. Google Translate can probably help with its Mic and Camera modes. *Ganbare!*
