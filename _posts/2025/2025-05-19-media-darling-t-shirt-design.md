I was looking through [Comptiq, Vol. 41, April 1988](https://archive.org/details/comptiq-vol.-41-april-1988/) and spotted [an illustration showing the relative size of 2" floppy disks](https://archive.org/details/comptiq-vol.-41-april-1988/Comptiq%20-%20Vol.%2041%20April%201988/page/n207/mode/2up)—used in some word processors at the time—compared to more common floppy disks: 8", 5", and 3.5".

Which got me thinking about the ever decreasing size of storage and how it might make for a nice illustration on a T-shirt. So I created technical drawings of the following media in decreasing size:

- 5.25" floppy disk
- 3.5" floppy disk
- MiniDisc
- CompactFlash
- SecureDigital
- MicroSD

## Alt Store

Some buyers may choose to buy from my alternate web store which ships from the UK.

[www.tshirtstudio.com/marketplace/gingerbeardman](https://www.tshirtstudio.com/marketplace/gingerbeardman)

This store has more limited colour choices, though you can edit that during checkout. YMMV.
