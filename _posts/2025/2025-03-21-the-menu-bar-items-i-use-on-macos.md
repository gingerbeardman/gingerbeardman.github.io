This is an expanded version of [a post I made to the MPU Talk forum](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/787-revisiting-our-mac-menu-bars/40090/44?u=gingerbeardman).

## Visible

  - [Eject Volumes](/2025/02/08/automating-the-cleaning-of-macos-specific-files-on-eject/)
- [Caffeine](https://www.caffeine-app.net) (used to set Mac not to sleep)
