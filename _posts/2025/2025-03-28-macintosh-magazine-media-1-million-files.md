I am proud to announce that my [Macintosh Magazine Media project](/2021/10/30/macintosh-magazine-media/) has surpassed my self-imposed goal of 1 million files, an achievement that fills me with both immense satisfaction and slight bewilderment.

If you've never heard of it before: it's an archive of vintage media containing mostly Macintosh files sourced from Japanese magazines, but featuring content from all over the world. A treasure trove time capsule for vintage computer nerds like myself.

Many thanks to [my Patreon subscribers](https://patreon.com/gingerbeardman) for their support!

I also indexed the latest Japanese Macintosh magazine media from redump.

## The process

For this many CDs we are talking multiple days of busy work to prepare them for sharing.

If you’re interested in the “process” for each CD here it is:

1. Find the CD available for sale in Japan (they're getting harder to find)
1. Purchase it with cold hard cash
1. Wait for delivery (I delay shipping until I have enough items to make it worthwhile)
1. Dump the CD using a suitable reader (fwiw [redump](http://redump.org) project is very specific)
1. Index the CD filesystem (I created my [own software stack](/2022/03/31/working-with-classic-macintosh-text-encodings-in-the-age-of-unicode/) for this)
1. Redo dump of any bad discs (there are always some!)
1. Scan the CD artwork
1. Prepare the upload and metadata .csv for [internetarchive cli tool](https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/cli.html)
1. Bulk upload (this takes an absolute age, 30–60 mins per CD)
1. Redo upload of any failed items (the cli is very error prone)

I'm not sure I'll buy any/many more discs, but never say never!

## Searching the collection

All disc ISO with text listings are available for download at [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman), but wait a minute!

Using my search engine ([read more](/2025/01/10/macintosh-magazine-media-search-engine-update/) about that) you can search by regex for file/directory name, file type, creator code: [gingerbeardman.com/mmm/](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/mmm/)

Or you can use DiscMaster to search inside content and grab individual files without having to download the whole ISO: [discmaster.textfiles.com](https://discmaster.textfiles.com)
