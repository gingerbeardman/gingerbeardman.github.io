In late 2024, I spent some time improving my tools by [building a set of extensions for Nova editor](/2024/10/17/extensions-for-nova-editor/) to streamline some time-consuming tasks I encounter during blogging and game development.

- Adds sorting, the ability to bookmark folders, marking of missing items, and other improvements.

## Markdown File Linker

- Results in the choice palette are now sorted by default using dates found in filenames.
- Along with other filtering improvements.

## Unwrap Paragraph

- You can now unwrap the text surrounding cursor, which removes some friction.
- In selected text multiple paragraphs will be unwrapped individually.

## Word Counter

*Plus!* I also released a brand new extension:
