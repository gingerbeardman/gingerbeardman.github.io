I've made a bunch of usability and quality of life changes to the [sfxr.lua](https://love2d.org/wiki/sfxr.lua) demo app.

- fix: getDirectoryItems (from a PR)
- fix: off by one sample length error (from a PR)
- fix: space bar was not playing the sound
- fix: selected wave form was being ignored (sounds were always square wave)
- fix: loaded wave form not updating the interface (but sound was playing correctly)
- add: clone method added to sfxr.lua
- add: history form with list of previous sounds, save current, and undo/redo
- add: "play on changes" so that any time you adjust a sound it plays automatically
- add: keyboard navigation in file picker (A–Z: jump to files, Enter: choose, Esc: close picker)
- add: window title reflects the most recent loaded/saved file
- add: window title and filename reflects last operation
- add: file selector shows data directory path
- add: unified save directory across platforms

At some point I'll fork the project on GitHub and file some PRs with my changes, but the repo for it seems very dead so I'll wait until I hear back from the owner. Source code is at the above link.
