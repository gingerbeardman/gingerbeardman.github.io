It's no secret that I'm a fan of an almost forgotten WiiWare game called [MaBoShi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaBoShi:_The_Three_Shape_Arcade). I've posted a [review](/2013/06/29/maboshi/), the [staff roll/credits](/2020/03/28/credits-maboshi-wiiware/) (for the first time in English), written an [FAQ strategy guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/wii/946472-maboshis-arcade/faqs/78205), managed to [score 1 million in its "circle" game on my Nintendo DS](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/625789610761842689), created [a way for you to play it more easily](/2024/04/18/per-game-skins-in-the-delta-classic-video-game-emulator-for-ios/) on your iPhone, and even [finally succeeded to make my own version](https://x.com/gingerbeardman/status/1826714059938693607) of the "circle" game over the course of many years. I never miss an opportunity to wax lyrical about its genius, so here I am once again to keep the fire burning.

MaBoShi was published in 2008 by Nintendo and developed by [Mindware Corp](http://www.pinball.co.jp/mindware/) who have [a long and well respected development history](https://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Mindware). The game was [critically acclaimed](https://www.metacritic.com/game/maboshis-arcade/critic-reviews/?platform=wii) on release, which might come as a shock if you've never heard of it. It was somewhat inaccessible: it was a hardcore arcade title only available digitally on a console that was maligned as being "for kids". To give a sense of time, the App Store on iPhone was barely a month old at the time of MaBoShi's release.

As part of the release promotional campaign [Micky Albert](https://www.4gamer.net/games/345/G034593/20161221168/) of Mindware Corp gave an interview with WiiWare World (now Nintendo Life) which can be read in [two](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/09/mindware_interview_part_1_maboshi_the_three_shape_arcade) [parts](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/10/mindware_interview_part_2_maboshi_the_three_shape_arcade). The team effort of the development of the Wii game is detailed in that interview. However, if we dig a little deeper we can find the true origins of the game in a couple of prototypes created by a Japanese indie developer. Over the years I have pieced together the interesting story of how MaBoShi came to be.

## The Long Tail

Kuniaki Watanabe ("kuni") is probably best known for his PlayStation open world exploration and crafting game [Panekit](https://www.mobygames.com/game/109325/panekit/), released in 1999. This was a product of Sony's [ゲームやろうぜ!](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ゲームやろうぜ!) ["Game Yaroze!" development programme](https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20051026/game.htm) (not to be confused with PlayStation’s 「ネットやろうぜ」 "Net Yaroze" dev kit). Panekit offered the type of easy, freeform crafting that would later appear in [Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts](https://www.mobygames.com/game/37770/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts/) and even later in [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.mobygames.com/game/203119/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/). Most famously Panekit [took 13 years to become profitable](https://www.siliconera.com/panekit-the-infinitive-crafting-toy-case-game-finally-sees-profits-after-13-years/).

In more recent years he's written a [book on game design](http://gihyo.jp/book/2016/978-4-7741-7944-5/), 組み立て×分解！ゲームデザイン ("Assembly × Disassembly! Game Design"), that goes into the mechanics that are used in his games, including MaBoShi. It's only available in Japanese but has a very friendly manga-style presentation and the game design techniques are easily understood.

Throughout the past 30 years kuni has been an indie developer, [developing for many platforms using a range of tools](https://k-u.hatenadiary.org/entries/1970/01/01). And this is where we pick up the origins of MaBoShi.

## Hot Soup Processor

[HSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Soup_Processor) could be thought of as a Japanese equivalent to something like [BlitzMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC), given that it started life as a version of BASIC, or perhaps [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) for a rough equivalent of its capabilities.

[ONION software](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/おにたま), creators of [HSP](http://www.onionsoft.net/hsp/), hold the annual HSP Program Contest and the results for all of these have been archived over the years. Nice work, ONION! We can do a web search of that domain to find mentions of kuni.

## Mosser

We find [one entry in HSP Program Contest 2004](https://www.onionsoft.net/hsp/contest2004/list_s3.html) called *Mosser*. A quick look at the image below shows that it was an early version of MaBoShi's "square" game, which later evolved into [Flametail on DSiWare](https://www.mobygames.com/game/87996/flametail/) in 2010. *Mosser* was awarded [first prize in the small game category](https://www.onionsoft.net/hsp/contest2004/place.html).

One of the judges was none other than Micky Albert of Mindware Corp—the company that would go on to develop MaBoShi! He and the other judges were very impressed with the gameplay and depth even at this prototype stage. Kuni would win a PlayStation Portable and some pinball art donated by Mindware who were a sponsor of the event. You can [read the judges thoughts](http://www.onionsoft.net/hsp/contest2004/result.html#368) and the game can be run in old versions of Windows.

## Circular

Kuni would create prototypes in [Flash Lite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Lite), which was a version of Flash that was suitable for running on low powered devices, including Japanese feature phones. If we search archived versions of kuni's old websites we can find [a download from 2003 called *Circular*](http://web.archive.org/web/20031202202659/http://www.din.or.jp:80/~ku_/junk/junk.htm). You can play this in your browser thanks to *Internet Archive*'s Wayback Machine and Ruffle, a web-based Flash emulator.

*Circular* is obviously an early version of MaBoShi's "circle" game.

## All bar one

So we have found two of the three games in MaBoShi, which leaves us with the "bar" game. I spoke to kuni and he mentioned that this did not exist as a prototype prior to work commencing on MaBoShi, so it was created for the game when it was decided that a third game would be welcome.

## Missing in action

At the time of release there were a couple of English videos of a "making of" developer interview shown in both North America and Europe that have since been lost to time. Nintendo Europe were kind enough to respond to my request about these videos, but told me that their archive currently only goes back to 2012 so we're sadly out of luck. Here are references I have found to the airing dates for [video 1](https://nintendoeverything.com/updates-to-the-nintendo-channel-32/) (Dec 2008) and [video 2](https://nintendoeverything.com/updates-to-the-nintendo-channel-36/) (Jan 2009).

These include the juicy fact that the game was initially green lit for the Game Boy Micro (a small Game Boy Advance, [marketed as being suitable for one-handed play for Japanese commuters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdAsnZlmQtM)) alongside the bitGenerations series, Polarium, Rhythm Paradise, but after the sales of the Micro were less than anticipated the development was moved to DS and eventually to Wii.
