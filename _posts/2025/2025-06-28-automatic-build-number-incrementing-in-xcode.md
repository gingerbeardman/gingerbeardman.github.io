There are many ways to do automatic build version number incrementing in Xcode. I don't know of any really easy universal way of doing it, so this is simply my preferred way of doing it. I just added it to a new project so thought I'd document if only for my own future reference!

----

## 1. Create a .xcconfig

- Add a file `BuildNumber.xcconfig` to your project
- Add that file to your `.gitignore` because it will change frequently
- Add a *Pre-Action Script* to your *Scheme*:
    - In Xcode, edit your scheme (*Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme*).
    - For both "Run" and "Archive" actions, add a *Pre-action* with a script like the one below
    - Here I'm using a reverse notation date and time format
    - Make sure to set "Provide build settings from" to your project

```sh
#!/bin/sh
BUILD_NUMBER=`date '+%y%m%d.%H%M'`

PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "$PROJECT_FILE_PATH" .xcodeproj)
echo "CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = $BUILD_NUMBER" > "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}/BuildNumber.xcconfig"

echo "Updated build number to: $BUILD_NUMBER"
```

## 2. Reference the .xcconfig in your project

- In your project set the base configuration file to your `BuildNumber.xcconfig`
    - In the main editor, youâ€™ll see two sections: *PROJECT* and *TARGETS*
    - Click the name of your project and make sure *Info* tab is selected
    - You can set the base configuration at the project level (as here) or for each target individually

## 3. Set the version to use the config variable

In the target build settings, set: Current Project Version to: `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`
- It will show the version number in place

## 4. Confirm by displaying the value in your app

- Use `CFBundleVersion` for the build version number
