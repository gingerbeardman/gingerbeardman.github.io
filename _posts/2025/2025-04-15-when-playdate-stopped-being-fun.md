For almost six years, [Playdate](https://play.date) (a little handheld gaming device with a crank input and 1-bit screen) was a space where I did some of my most creative and personal work. I embraced its quirks, shipped over twenty releases, and explored what a tiny, constrained device could do. It brought me joy, challenge, and a sense of purpose.

But over time, that feeling changed. After a difficult situation involving targeted harassment, and no meaningful follow-up from [Panic](https://www.panic.com) or community moderators, I started to feel disconnected from the scene. I gave it time, hoped things might shift, but ultimately the silence made it hard to keep building with the same heart.

So, I’m stepping back. Not permanently, not dramatically—just with clarity. Right now, this isn’t the environment I can thrive in. If that changes, I’d be happy to return. For now, I want to leave a record of what I made. I’m proud of all of it.

Be excellent to each other. And have fun.
