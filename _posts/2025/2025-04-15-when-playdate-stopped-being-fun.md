I've been asked a bunch of times recently why I'm no longer actively developing for [Playdate](https://play.date) (a unique handheld console with crank control and 1-bit display). It's an understandable question because it must seem odd that somebody who was perhaps the most prolific developer on the platform, most likely the only full-time developer on the platform, and who lived and breathed it for almost 6 years could suddenly stop doing so.

My journey with Playdate began with excitement and innovation, leading to numerous released games and recognition within the community and wider industry. The process of creating games for Playdate was incredibly rewarding, with many high points, including award-winning projects and creative breakthroughs. 

Unfortunately, I also faced challenging interactions with other developers and a lack of support from key members of the community, which took away from that enjoyment. This culminated in a campaign of targeted harassment. I reached out to Panic leadership and whilst they acknowledged the issue there has been no further follow-up. These events have ultimately led me to step away from the scene and channel my passion into other platforms.

This post is purely to get what happened out in the open, and I've gone out of my way to withhold the name of any person or game. If you do manage to figure out who is who or which game is which in this story—well done!—but please don't harass anybody. It sucks, that's the point.

## Timeline

If you're interested in how and when things happened:

- `2019-05` 📦 [Playdate is announced on the cover of EDGE magazine](https://x.com/gingerbeardman/status/1131583062607896576)
- `2019-07` 🍒 Granted access to Panic/Playdate Slack channel and Playdate SDK
- `2019-07` 🎴 Junior Hanafuda in the running for Playdate Season 1 (with [Louie Mantia](https://lmnt.me))

[expand]

> I first heard about Playdate when it featured on the cover of EDGE, but I'd been talking with Louie Mantia for a while about a Hanafuda game I was making for PICO8 (fun fact: I was the first public user of PICO8, #6). Given that my game was already written in Lua it seemed like a great opportunity to take it further. I have no idea how Louie managed to keep Playdate a secret from me, he already knew about it as he is friends with Panic staff. That was useful as he already had his foot in the door and got us hardware access. From what I can recall, we were asked to give an estimate and I replied that it was up to him and that I just needed a deadline to hit.

[/expand]

- `2020-03` 🍒 Received pre-release Playdate hardware
- `2020-03` 🦠 COVID-19 takes over the world and gives me a ton of free time
- `2020-03` 💬 Official, private Playdate Discord server begins
- `2020-04` 🚙 I begin development of prototypes, including [Daily Driver](/tag/dailydriver/)
- `2020-05` 💬 [Playdate Dev Forum](https://devforum.play.date) opens
- `2020-05` 💬 [Playdate Developer Preview](https://play.date/update-oct/) hardware access begins
- `2020-07` 💬 [Playdate Squad Discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaydateConsole/comments/hkjbjt/) server started
- `2020-11` 🤬 A Playdate Season 1 dev reveals they were making a game inspired by Daily Driver
- `2020-11` 💤 I take 6 months away from Playdate development because of this

[expand]

> Whilst I had the SDK from very early days (version 0.7.1, dated July 2019) it was only when I got the hardware in my hands that it became obvious how the device was unique and what games would work best on it. I dove headlong into making a bunch of varied prototypes, one of which quickly turned into Daily Driver. With Hanafuda off the table, I needed a "main" project to focus on and it was at this point in April 2020 that I decided to go full-time on Playdate.<br><br>At this time comms were on a private Discord, and every so often some new devs would arrive either invited by Panic or via the Developer Preview. I was proudly building in public, so everybody could see what I was doing and my experiments such as breaking the 50fps barrier and drawing a shade of grey by flashing black and white. What I wasn't expecting was for another developer to copy my ideas. I know this happens in the game industry, but in such a small community it seemed more than a little out of place. Anyway, it was revealed in late-2020 that for a period of time after seeing Daily Driver one of the other developers were making a very similar game, though eventually they changed tact and their Season 1 game is an entirely different concept. Regardless, this news shook my world entirely. I reached out to Panic staff about it but the issue was never addressed.

- `2021-05` 🤕 I resume Playdate development
- `2021-07` 📦 [Playdate pre-orders begin](https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1418254540042764293)
- `2021-08` 🚙 [Daily Driver teaser artwork](/2021/08/23/daily-driver-teaser-artwork/) revealed
- `2021-08` 🤬 A developer expresses their intent to imitate my teaser artwork style

[expand]

> By 2021 it's still uncertain when Playdate will release, and if or how Daily Driver will release. I continue working on it and doing more prototypes on the side. I start to think about self-releasing Daily Driver and prototype a physical release in a MiniDisc jewel case with custom artwork and an SD card containing the game and a small manual. I commissioned artist Vxcl to render clay-style artwork inspired by the hand-made artwork on vintage Japanese game and computer magazines. Moments after I announce [my teaser art style](/2021/08/23/daily-driver-teaser-artwork/)—at this point uncommon in the gaming sphere and unique in the Playdate scene—a developer tells me that they're intending to use that style for their Playdate game. Again, it seems a little bit too close to home to do the same as another developer in such a small scene. Thankfully never followed through with this intention.

- `2022-02` 📦 [Playdate SDK](https://news.play.date/news/sdk-now-available/) goes public

[expand]

> Playdate launches and is a success. People start to think about Season 2, a store, or more official releases. I was contacted by Panic and asked if I would be interested in Daily Driver releasing in a set of games including Oom, Faraway Fairway, Sound Mind, and maybe some others. Naturally, I immediately agreed, offered a tight timeline, but then never heard a thing for 2 months after which I was sent a contract. But my already short timeline was 2 months shorter and my musician was otherwise engaged so there was no longer time to get the game done. So, reluctantly I had to pass. Of course, some of the listed games are still yet to release so perhaps my musician and I would have had time to finish it after all! The benefit of hindsight.

[expand]

> 2023 was undoubtedly the most productive year of my entire career. I blogged about it in early-2023, but in a nutshell it started with the release of Sparrow Solitaire and went from strength to strength. A bunch of games and a whirlwind September resulted in a game, YOYOZO, that went on to receive a place in Ars Technica's "Best Games of 2023" list. alongside Super Mario Wonder, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Baldur's Gate 3 to name but a few. If I'm honest that was great to receive but a personal congratulations from Lucas Pope was equally great.<br><br>My reaction to the accolade was to think about how amazing it would be for the Playdate community, to have such a light shone on it. Sadly, that turned out to not be the case and from this point on I noticed a sort of "him versus us" attitude from some members of the community. For me, game dev is not a competition but rather an industry wide effort to progress the art form. I'm just creating the types of games I want to play myself and if other people like them then that's cool. But awards and accolades are not my motivation—having fun is my motivation.

[expand]

> I'm not sure how you follow up a GOTY accolade, so I decided to just take it easy and see what came of it. It was nice to win some community awards, and although none of my games were selected for Season 2, I continued development of both old and new projects. I was shaken by developers continuing to imitate my vibe rather than coming up with one of their own. To scratch an itch I spent couple of weeks making a new version of one of my oldest games, Bender, eventually calling it Bender 2: Bend Harder. It was an expanded version of a concept I had made for the web back in 2012, itself based on a piece of artwork from the 2011 Famicase exhibition, with permission. I've always been open about my inspiration and sources and wrote a full history of Bender from 2012 to 2024 in a [blog post](/2024/10/08/bender-2-bend-harder-for-playdate/) and in the game manual.<br><br>Upon release the first message I received was from another developer who said (I'm paraphrasing) "I think this is based on an existing robot copyright; you might want change it, or watch out". Given that there are no robots in the game, and only implied in the story and teaser artwork, I thought this was a joke (I'm not great at subtlety). So, I went along with what I thought was a joke replying something vaguely affirmative. As this person went up a gear and became more intense I realised they were actually serious, so deleted my comment. Sadly, this person did not drop the issue and instead hounded and harassed me and eventually, apparently accidentally, recruited some people from outside the community to harass me. I know this because the person was happy to own and admit to the events.<br><br>At this point I felt quite unsafe so withdrew from all Playdate related socials and filed complaints with both Playdate Squad moderators and also with Panic/Playdate management. Surprisingly, even with written ownership/evidence, Playdate Squad mods decided that there was nothing to do. Panic acknowledged the issue, but I never heard anything more from them about it.<br><br>My issue is not with the how and why the harassment happened, I feel there is no place for harassment under any circumstances. But rather that it happened at all, and was subsequently decided not worth worrying about. The response I was hoping for was, without naming and shaming, letting the community know that a case of harassment had happened and that it is not acceptable. Which is basically why I'm writing this blog post 6 months after the fact.

- `2025-04` 😞 The issue of harassment remains unresolved

## Postponed Projects

I always say that nothing is ever wasted in game dev, but there's no denying I had *works* in progress:

- Aero Club — flight school simulation inspired by "Mode 7" and Pilotwings on SNES
- Beatnik — rhythm game with innovative interactive music and dynamic beat-responsive visuals
- Cosmic Trash — arcade action puzzle with realtime ray-traced graphics, yes, really!
- Daily Driver — 60fps arcade racing with pre-rendered graphics (reborn as [Dream Ride](/2025/01/05/dream-ride-for-sega-dreamcast-and-emulators/))
- Koatari — 100fps arcade game "pachinko with power-ups" and innovative pinball-inspired visuals
- Mole Hole — modern version of a pseudo-escape-room maze experience by Thoru Yamamoto

## Takeaways

My main takeaway is that the Playdate community and ecosystem is just like any other, flaws and all.

Problems cannot be wished away. They require action, however uncomfortable that may be. Sweeping things under the rug, putting your fingers in your ears, or your head in the sand—or any other analogy about avoidance—doesn't make the problem go away but rather allows it to fester.

No matter what, seeing [YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/) listed among the "Best Games of 2023"—alongside Super Mario Wonder and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom—is an honour that will stay with me forever.

Be excellent to each other. And have fun.
