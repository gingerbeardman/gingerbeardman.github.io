I've been asked a bunch of times recently why I'm no longer actively developing for [Playdate](https://play.date) (a unique handheld console with crank control and 1-bit display). It's an understandable question because it must seem odd that somebody who was perhaps the most prolific developer on the platform and who lived and breathed it for almost 6 years could suddenly stop doing so.

My journey with Playdate began with excitement and innovation, leading to numerous released games and recognition within the community and wider industry. The process of creating games for Playdate was incredibly rewarding, with many high points, including award-winning projects and creative breakthroughs. Unfortunately, I also faced challenging interactions and a lack of support from key members of the community, which took away from that enjoyment. These have ultimately led me to step away from the scene and channel my passion into other platforms.

## Postponed Projects

I always say that nothing is ever wasted in game dev, but there's no denying I had *works in progress*:

- Aero Club — flight school simulation inspired by "Mode 7" and Pilotwings on SNES
- Beatnik — rhythm game with innovative interactive music and dynamic beat-responsive visuals
- Cosmic Trash — arcade action puzzle with real-time ray-traced graphics—yes, really!
- Daily Driver — arcade racing with pre-rendered graphics running at 60fps (reborn as [Dream Ride](/2025/01/05/dream-ride-for-sega-dreamcast-and-emulators/))
- Koatari — arcade game "pachinko with power-ups" and innovative pinball-inspired visuals
- Mole Hole — modern version of the "escape room" maze experience by Thoru Yamamoto

## Takeaways

My main takeaway is that the Playdate community and ecosystem is just like any other, flaws and all.

No matter what, seeing [YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/) listed among the "Best Games of 2023"—alongside Super Mario Wonder and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom—is an honour that will stay with me forever.

Be excellent to each other. And have fun.
