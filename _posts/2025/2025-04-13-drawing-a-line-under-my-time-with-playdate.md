I've been asked a bunch of times recently why I'm no longer actively developing for [Playdate](https://play.date) (a unique handheld console with crank control and 1-bit display). It's an understandable question because it must seem odd that somebody who lived and breathed a platform for almost 6 years could suddenly stop doing so.

My journey with Playdate began with excitement and innovation, leading to numerous released games and recognition within the community. While there were many high points, including award-winning projects and creative breakthroughs, I also faced several challenges that ultimately led to my decision to step away from the scene.

## Postponed Projects

I always say that nothing is ever wasted in game dev, but there's no denying I had works in progress:

- Aero Club—a "mode 7"-style flight school game inspired by Pilotwings on SNES
- Beatnik—a rhythm game with innovative interactive music and visual feedback
- Cosmic Trash—arcade action puzzle with real-time ray-traced graphics
- Daily Driver—arcade racing with pre-rendered graphics running at 60fps (reborn as [Dream Ride](/2025/01/05/dream-ride-for-sega-dreamcast-and-emulators/))
- Koatari—arcade game "pachinko with power-ups" and innovative pinball-inspired visual feedback
- Mole Hole—modern version of the "escape room" maze experience by Thoru Yamamoto

## Takeaways

My main takeaway is that the Playdate community and ecosystem is just like any other, flaws and all.

No matter what, seeing [YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/) listed among the "Best Games of 2023"—alongside Super Mario Wonder and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom—is an honour that will stay with me forever.
