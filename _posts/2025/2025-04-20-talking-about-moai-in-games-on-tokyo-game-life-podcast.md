You may or may not know that I run the website [moai.games](https://moai.games) which features a catalogue of screenshots showing Moai appearances in video games. At the time of writing there are over 1000 games listed going all the way back to the early 1980s. âœ¨ðŸ‘‹ðŸ—¿âœ¨

[Tokyo Game Life](https://tokyogamelife.com/episode/moai-in-japanese-games-with-matt-sephton-uncharted-waters-new-horizons) reached out and I chatted to them a bit about all of that cool and nerdy stuff. Listen in your usual podcast app or using the embedded player below.
