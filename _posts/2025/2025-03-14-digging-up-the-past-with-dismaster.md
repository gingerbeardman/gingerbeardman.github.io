[DiscMaster](https://discmaster.textfiles.com) is an alternative interface for collections of software that have been uploaded to Internet Archive. It allows you to drill into disk images at the file level and preview the contents in-place, download individual folders, zips, images, or whatever you like. It's been around for a while but has become bigger and better with the introduction of DiscMaster 2, which is ingesting huge amounts of new files daily. But how to keep up with this firehose!?

## Automated Searching

One of the great things about DiscMaster is that you can subscribe to an RSS feed of any search result, which means you'll be notified of new matches as they are indexed without the need to manually search on the website.

I have a bunch of searches including [Hanafuda](/2021/10/31/hypercard-hanafuda/), various computer artists and developers ([Thoru Yamamoto](/2023/12/16/see-the-sky-thoru-yamamoto-christmas-story-for-playdate/)), particular apps, specific file types (`PICT/SaMe` for [MaciGame tilesets](/2023/05/04/macigame-user-created-graphics/)), and for purely selfish reasons... searches for my own name. It's fun to see where my early software was distributed up to 30 years after the fact.

## Class of ’93

So far the oldest thing of mine is Chaos Calc 2, my fractal explorer, this version from May 1993 when I was 16 years young! I have a pretty good memory and can tell you that I received zero registrations for that [shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware) app, but I did get one call from somebody who wanted to be certain that their £5 GBP registration fee would absolutely definitely receive a floppy disk in return. I guess they were unconvinced because they never sent me any money!

There are references to programs (this what apps were called back on the Atari ST) that I had forgotten about but after reading their names can now recall complete details of (palette manager, boot tools), some I can recall partial details (menu system), and programs that I have completely forgotten the details of (a front end for a ray tracing program). Curiously not listed are text file viewer and kids paint programs that I still have source code for.

## Chaos Calc 2

It's been 30 years but it only took a moment for me to recall how to use the app and what all the different menu options did, even without consulting the readme. This is running at 32MHz with maths co-processor (compared to stock 8MHz with no co-processor) as your time is valuable!
