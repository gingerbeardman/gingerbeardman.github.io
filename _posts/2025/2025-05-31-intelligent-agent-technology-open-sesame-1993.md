After years of unsuccessful attempts to find the name of a long-forgotten app through Google, I tried pasting my query into Gemini:

> "Back in my teens I saw a software demo for a Mac/Windows app that tracked what you were doing and offered to complete repetitive tasks for you. Like renaming all files in a folder it would interrupt after a few and offer to do the rest. Maybe late 80s or early 90s."

Gemini instantly responded with the app by name and with references. (out of all the services I tried, ChatGPT was the only other one to ID the app correctly.)

Open Sesame! was "the world's first intelligent software assistant for the Macintosh. It observes how you work, learns your repetitive patterns, and then offers to do them for you. Automatically."

## One Thousand and One Nights

I remember seeing a demo of Open Sesame! in the early/mid-1990s. Although the demo failed—the Macintosh was supposed to prompt the user to continue renaming a series of files in sequence—the concept left a lasting impression on me.

Over the years I've tried to find the event I saw the app at, the app itself, or any other information. I asked other classic Macintosh enthusiasts. Time after time I failed to find the answer.

So I find it delightfully circular that in 2025 I am using the "ai" benefits of machine learning to find out the name of an app built around machine learning in 1993.
