On September 30th, 2023, I was sitting in the cinema [waiting for an anniversary screening](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/1708437276756214147) of Talking Heads *"[Stop Making Sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Making_Sense)"* to begin when I got a message from [Panic](https://panic.com). They asked if I was familiar with Sensible Soccer. Naturally, I was—I’ve played it since its release in 1992, as man and boy. Back in 2000, I’d even made my own arcade-style take on it called Simple Soccer, and in 2002 I designed an [official Sensible Soccer T-shirt](/2002/05/23/sensible-soccer-t-shirt/) that was sold on the high street. Panic had no idea about any of this, but luck works in funny ways sometimes.

Panic’s idea was to make a soccer game for [Playdate](https://play.date), tied in as a promotional companion to the soccer-infused first-person slice-of-life game [Despelote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despelote) (out today—1st May, 2025). Very cool.

I was super keen, as you’d imagine, and quickly got to work on a [prototype](https://gingerbeardman.itch.io/prototypes-for-playdate) (download at the link). It let you move around the pitch, zoom in and out, and switch between different pitch surfaces. I sent it off and asked for a budget and scope. With the expectation set that the project was going forwards and while waiting for a reply, I kept going: I got the ball moving (using the same sort of ball movement trick I first solved 25 years ago and more recently reused for [Fore! Track](/2023/06/26/ball-und-panzer-golf-making-a-playdate-game-in-a-week/)), and had two AI-controlled teams running around the pitch, tracking the ball using the classic Sensible Soccer [grid system](https://readonlymemory.com/the-making-of-sensible-soccer/).

But I never heard back about the budget. So I stopped—just before adding goal-scoring. It would’ve been so cool.

Lesson learned. I now always ask for a contract upfront and of course don't do spec work. If a client wants me to build something, they need to commit—and at the very least, meet me on the halfway line.
