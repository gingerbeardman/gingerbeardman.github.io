Marguerite is a defunct Japanese website, previously at [https://marguerite.jp](https://marguerite.jp) (dead link) that hosted HTML5 implementations of Hanafuda and Mahjong.

Their Hanafuda in particular was very well done, offering a variety of rulesets some of which are difficult to find in video game form and impossible to find in a browser game. The experience was single player versus one or two CPU players.

The complete list of rules offered:

**2-player**
- Koi-Koi
- Mushi (aka "Insect")
- Roppyakken (aka "600")
- Hachi-Hachi (aka "88")
- Hachi (aka "8")

**3-player**
- Hana-Awase
- Hachi-Hachi (aka "88")
- Sudaoshi
- Roppyakken (aka "600")

## Gone but not forgotten

The site went offline mid-2022, about a year ago at this point, and all was thought to be lost. We had tried the Wayback Machine but the archive seemed incomplete. 

This week Marguerite was mentioned on the [Hanafuda Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mKbdwy9), so I decided to try again. Taking a fresh look at the state of the site, it seemed to be stalling trying to load two images.

A couple of small changes later (two hard-coded URLs in the JavaScript pointed to the dead website) I managed to get the desktop version of the Marguerite Hanafuda working locally!

## It's alive!

So, I'm now hosting a mirror copy on my website: [https://marguerite.gingerbeardman.com](https://marguerite.gingerbeardman.com)

Notes:
- Sound requires Chrome
- Safari/Chrome built-in translation works well for this web app
- Some links out of the game will be broken
- if Marguerite.jp comes back online I'll remove my mirror

## Mobile & Mahjong?

Sadly the Wayback Machine archive of the Marguerite website is incomplete, so Mobile Hanafuda is lost as are both versions of Marguerite Mahjong.
