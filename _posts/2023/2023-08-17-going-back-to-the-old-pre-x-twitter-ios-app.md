Here's how you can downgrade to an older version of Twitter (pre-X changes) and install it in a way that means _it will not be automatically updated_.

## Downloading the old version

This is the trickiest part of the process as it requires installing some old software and following a guide. But don't worry — it's not that difficult! You'll need access to an old version of iTunes (so it's most easily done using Windows) and about 15 minutes to carry out the steps.

[Follow this great step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/qnblackcat/How-to-Downgrade-apps-on-AppStore-with-iTunes-and-Charles-Proxy). It might seem complicated but it is quite easy. A high level summary of what is involved in the guide is as follows:

1. Install old iTunes & Charles Proxy
2. Configure intercepting of the latest app download
3. Change the version of the app to be downloaded (I chose build 858339189 aka version 9.66)
4. Download the old version

The result of this process is a completely legitimate .ipa file, tied to your Apple ID in exactly the same way that apps are normally. As such, the resulting file can be installed on your device and once installed would be no different to an app you've downloaded directly from the App Store. This also means that if you share your .ipa with somebody else they would need to log in to your account using your Apple ID to do so, which is not so desirable. Best if they download their own app.

## Avoiding updates

If you install the .ipa file onto your phone using Finder, iTunes, Apple Configurator it will install just fine. But, because of the metadata that is included the .ipa, it will be checked for updates and automatically updated soon after installation.

However, there is a little-known way to install an old version of an app on an iOS device which will prevent it from being checked for updates. I discovered this method back in 2016 when I used it to downgrade the eBay and Gmail Inbox apps.

## Installing the app

Before we begin, remove the app you want to downgrade from your device by tapping and holding on it. Make sure to backup any data you need from it! You'll need to login once the old app is reinstalled.

1. Copy your backup of .ipa somewhere where you can work on it.
2. Open the .ipa with Archive Utility to decompress it.
3. Expand the resulting folder until you get to the Payload.
4. You'll see Twitter.app (on macOS the icon has a "no entry sign" because it's an iOS app)
5. Connect your device
6. Open Apple Configurator
7. Double click on your device
8. Choose Apps from the sidebar
9. Drop the Twitter.app from the Payload folder onto the list of apps
10. Wait for the app to install on your device

You’re done!

## Questions 

**Why does this work?**
    Installing the payload directly means the App Store app has no record of the app being installed so it does not check for updates to it. You can confirm this by going to the .

**Will it stop working at some point?**
    Eventually, yes. But let's enjoy it for as long as we can.
