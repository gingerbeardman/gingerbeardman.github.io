I recently played through COMPILE’s うさ雀外伝 俺が切り札！ “Usa suzume gaiden ore ga kirifuda!” (a ninja-themed Hanafuda Koi-Koi game for PC-98 featured on Disc Station Vol. 10) and took the liberty of recording its great soundtrack as I went along.

## How to play the game

I'm going to recommend using RetroArch to play this:
1. [download RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms)
2. [download a zip of the game](https://archive.org/download/NeoKobe-NecPc-98012017-11-17/Compile.zip/Compile%2FDisc%20Station%20Vol.%2010%2FDisc%20Station%20Vol.%2010%20%28Usajan%20Gaiden%20-%20Ore%20ga%20Kirifuda%21%29%20%5BFD%5D.zip)
3. [download PC-98 System files](https://github.com/Abdess/retroarch_system/tree/libretro/NEC%20-%20PC-98)
4. start RetroArch
5. system files will need to go into RetroArch System folder, check Settings > Directory > System/BIOS and move them there
6. download PC-98 core: main menu > online updater > core downloader > NEC PC-98 (Neko project II Kai)
7. start the game: main menu > load content > (choose game zip) > load > NEC PC-98

You can play the game using mouse, though I used the right analog stick and a single button of a game controller...have fun!

## Notes

Some interesting things about this game:
- a draw results in the round being replayed
- koi-koi increases your "level-up" which counts along a sword, pretty cool visualisation
- your score doesn't double if you finish a round after the opponent calls koi-koi
- I can't see any way to check the current score, so i memorise it as i go
- if you lose to an opponent you can simply try again by choosing them from the map screen
- it has a cool soundtrack!
