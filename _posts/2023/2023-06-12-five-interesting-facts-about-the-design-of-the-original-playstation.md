Some things you probably didn’t realise about the design of the original [Sony PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)):

- it was inspired by Apple's [Macintosh Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus)
- the colour is grey with a hint of violet to counteract ageing/yellowing
- Sony acquired the PlayStation name from Yamaha
- it led to the [VAIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaio) range of PCs

Bonus fact:

- VAIO was originally an acronym for [Video Audio Input Output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaio#Etymology)
