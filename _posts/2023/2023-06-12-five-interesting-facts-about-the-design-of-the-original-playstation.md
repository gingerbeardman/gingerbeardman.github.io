Some things you probably didn’t realise about the design of the original *[Sony PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console))*:

- it was inspired by Apple's *[Macintosh Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus)*
- the colour is grey with a hint of violet to counteract plastic ageing/yellowing
- *Sony* acquired the PlayStation name from Yamaha
- it led to the *[VAIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaio)* range of PCs

**Bonus fact:**

- *[VAIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaio#Etymology)* was originally an acronym for Video Audio Input Output
