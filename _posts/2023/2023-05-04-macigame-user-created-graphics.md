I recently collected over 250(!) sets of user created graphics for [MaciGame](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/macigame) the classic Macintosh tile-matching puzzle game by Takeshi "KEN" Takahashi.

> まきがめ (MaciGame) was a wildly popular game worldwide in the mid-to-late 1990s, and there was even a play guide book published about it in its native Japan! The game is a variation of さめがめ ([SameGame](https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/SameGame)) by Eiji "Kyoto" Fukumoto, which is in turn a variation of the original game in the genre: [Chain Shot](https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ky6k-mrb/chainsht.htm) by Kuniaki "Morisuke" Moribe.
> 
> The goal of this type of game is to clear the board of blocks by clicking on groups of two or more, empty space is then removed vertical by the remaining blocks dropping down and horizontally by empty columns being replaced by their rightmost column. This means that over time blocks converge in the lower left of the play area.

The user-created graphic sets were all sourced from the amazing [Vector.co.jp](https://www.vector.co.jp/vpack/filearea/osx/game/puzzle/makigame/), extracted from all manner of esoteric vintage archives, organised and packaged as a single compressed disk image to make using them much quicker and easier. [Download it at Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/macigame).

> Tips: you can browse the folder as a GraphicConverter slideshow to more quickly and easily figure out which you'd like to use or install. The easiest way of using a graphics set is to double click it and it will open MaciGame with the new graphics loaded, though a few images may not have the correct `SaMe` creator code so may need to either have that reset, or be loaded manually using the game menu.

Thanks to [Izumi Okano](https://twitter.com/haeckel) for letting me know about this archive of user created graphics, and also [my Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/gingerbeardman) for allowing me to preserve this type of content.

## My Favourites

As well as recovering the infamous _[Panty](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA001976/index_e.html)[Cat](http://www.kibo.com/exegesis/panty_cat.shtml)_ graphics set — which was removed after version 1.74 of MaciGame — I also discovered all manner of beautiful, clever, and some times brain-melting graphics. 

Tile sets with 16 cells allow tiles that change their appearance based on matching neighbours. That means melting faces, multi-headed xenomorph, water pipes, DNA sequences, impossible key chains, mutant fish bones, weird blobs with faces, intertwining branches, mole burrows and more.

A small selection of my favourites are below:
