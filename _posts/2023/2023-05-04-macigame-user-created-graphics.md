I recently collected over 250(!) sets of user created graphics for [MaciGame](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/macigame) the classic Macintosh tile-matching puzzle game. 

> MaciGame was a wildly popular game worldwide in the mid-to-late 1990s, and there was even a play guide book published about it in its native Japan! The game is a variation of [SameGame](https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/SameGame) which is in turn a variation of the original game in the genre: [Chain Shot](https://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ky6k-mrb/chainsht.htm) by Kuniaki Moribe "Morisuke". 
> 
> The goal of this type of game is to clear the board of blocks by clicking on groups of two or more, empty space is then removed vertical by the remaining blocks dropping down and horizontally by empty columns being replaced by their rightmost column. This means that over time blocks converge in the lower left of the play area.

The user-created graphic sets were all sourced from the amazing Vector.co.jp, extracted from all manner of esoteric vintage archives, organised and packaged as a single compressed disk image to make using them much quicker and easier. [Download it at Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/macigame).

Tip: you can browse the folder as a GraphicConverter slideshow to more quickly and easily figure out which you'd like to use or install.

Thanks to [Izumi Okano](https://twitter.com/haeckel) for letting me know about this archive of user created graphics, and also [my Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/gingerbeardman) for allowing me to preserve this type of content.

## My Favourites

As well as recovering the infamous _[Panty](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA001976/index_e.html)[Cat](http://www.kibo.com/exegesis/panty_cat.shtml)_ graphics set — which was removed after version 1.74 of MaciGame — I also discovered all manner of beautiful, clever, and some times brain-melting graphics. A small selection of my favourites are below:
