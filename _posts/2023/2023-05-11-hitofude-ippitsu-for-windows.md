一筆 ("Hitofude" = Single Stroke) aka "Ippitsu" is a puzzle game by H.Hirabayashi.

Released in 1995, a decade before *Mitchell Corp* & *Nintendo*'s Polarium 直感ヒトフデ ("Chokkan Hitofude" = Intuitive Single Stroke) & Polarium Advance 通勤ヒトフデ ("Tsūkin Hitofude" = Commuting Single Stroke).

As huge fan of the Polarium games this discovery has rocked my world.

You can read about it in [this 1997 feature at Vector](https://www.vector.co.jp/magazine/special/970912/sp7091211.html) and [download it from its listing page](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win31/game/se024209.html). It will run on Windows 3.x and Windows 95, at least. I'm running here in English Windows 95 through DOSbox-x.
