Whilst searching for something else entirely I stumbled across these images and was struck by just how beautiful they are. The artwork is by [Barbara Nessim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Nessim) and was featured as the cover and section pages in the [September 1984 (Vol 9, No 10) issue of BYTE magazine](https://archive.org/details/BYTE_Vol_09-10_1984-09_Computer_Graphics/mode/2up). Larger versions are [at the bottom](#scans) of this blog post.

They were drawn during a residency at Time Life in NYC, using a Norpak IPS-2 Videotex (NAPLPS/Telidon) system, running on a PDP-11/03. This offered 6 drawing modes (arc, rectangle, circle, line, dot and polygon) and 12 colours plus black and white. That equates to a computer system roughly equivalent to an Apple II running a rudimentary graphics application, in fact you could get an add-on card for the Apple II to give it full [Norpak Telidon capabilities](https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Norpak_Telidon_Graphics_System). The main benefit of the Norpak IPS-2 computer system was that it had pen/stylus input.

My first thought was "such cool pixel art!" but a little bit more reading shows that they are actually vector illustrations. [NAPLPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLPS) is an early graphics format which could [represent both text and vector graphics](https://archive.org/details/telidonbook0000unse/page/116/mode/2up) with all coordinates and other properties - such as fill pattern and density - encoded as ASCII for easy transmission. It was [designed to display information on TVs](https://www.friendsofcrc.ca/Projects/Telidon/Telidon.html), and also used for display on terminals, in BBS software, and on the [Prodigy online service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)). Users from around the world might be more familiar with Teletext, which is a close relative of Videotex.

Doing pure illustration using a system meant for creating pages of information is exactly the type of software subversion I love to discover!

[Barbara Nessim](http://www.barbaranessim.com) is a name I was already familiar with, as I'd seen her mentioned and [interviewed](https://archive.org/details/verbum502unse/page/8/mode/1up) in [Verbum magazine](/2019/07/10/verbum-journal-of-personal-computer-aesthetics/), [COMPUTE magazine](https://archive.org/details/compute-magazine), in various books about illustration, and regarding her groundbreaking interactive art exhibition/installation [Random Access Memories](https://digitalartarchive.siggraph.org/artwork/random-access-memories-400/) (1992) - which addressed world issues such as migration and population growth and allowed visitors to operate a Macintosh containing the work, selecting images and printing their own customised booklet of her work with their choice of national flag on the cover. [Source 1](https://archive.org/details/computersinartde0000kerl/page/12/mode/1up) [and 2](https://archive.org/details/cyberartsexplori0000unse/page/n207/mode/1up)

Whilst I had seen other early computer work by Barbara - [portraits](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1257731/ode-to-the-statue-of-photograph-barbara-nessim/), [nudes](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1257732/reclining-nude-photograph-barbara-nessim/), [abstract](http://www.barbaranessim.com/1980s-computer-works/cikairn7mb0di14fz72fvzubvplcu4) (all of which are worth checking out!) - I had never seen work quite like these images from BYTE. 

The chunky scan-line gaps in between the rows of pixels are the result of these images being photographs of the monitor on which they were displayed. Screenshots had existed since the 1960s but in the 1980s getting such an image of a mainframe was still not easy or universal. Instead images were saved by pointing a camera at the screen, capturing the image on 35mm slide film, and printing them by [cibachrome process](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/explore/glossary-of-art-terms/cibachrome-print). Which is really saying something! Of course, I think the photos are much better than screenshots because of the scan-lines, the phosphor glow, the bleeding of colours, and the general analog feel to the whole thing.

Before and after the 80s Barbara carved out a hugely successful career for herself, encompassing many different forms of [art, teaching and activism](https://www.printmag.com/culturally-related-design/gloria-steinem-barbara-nessim-writers-artists-role-models/).

Published at a time when there was great unease about the arrival of computers in the world of graphics. This is a great piece and goes into how the works were created even down to which tools or shapes were used to draw particular aspects of a drawing, and how they were layered, and mostly shows her love for the arc tool! It also describes the IPS-2 computer system. Essential reading!
