I have a Becker Traffic Pro 7949 (a re-badged Becker Cascade with a green OLED screen) navigation unit in my LHD Renault Twingo mk1. This unit was bundled with high end sports cars of German and Italian origin, but I added one to my lowly Twingo because it's a 1DIN headunit with great sound quality, with navigation and music support from CF card, giving spoken and on-screen turn by turn directions!

A while ago I hacked the CF card structure to allow use of larger capacity cards to more easily store maps and music side-by-side. Good times!

The maps for this thing were long discontinued, but for a while users such as myself were able to use maps made for BMW's business fleet (with partial postcode search) and more recently Mercedes-Benz (with no postcode search). 

It's also possible to add speed limit and camera data through injecting a new file into the split ISO filesystem. This relied on using Windows and some old apps.

Today I wrote a small shell script to do the same on macOS (and probably Linux, and maybe Windows).
