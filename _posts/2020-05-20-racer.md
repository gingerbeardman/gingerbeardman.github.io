The Collector prototype didn't end up being as fun as I had hoped, but it interestingly felt a bit like driving. So I wondered whether it would change the feeling by putting some different graphics on top of it. I ripped some graphics from the arcade game Badlands and added one simple collision detection and there it was! The first recognisable driving game that turned into Daily Driver.
