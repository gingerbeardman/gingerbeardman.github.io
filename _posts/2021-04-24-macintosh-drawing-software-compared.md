Below is a list of various drawing applications that are available to use with System 7.

I'm mostly interested in apps that can do both of pixel and vector, support for layers and transparency so thought this table might be useful for at-a-glance comparisons. Apps run in both mono or colour, unless stated.

Deneba artWorks is a standout app that can do both pixel and vector and has layers and partial transparency. The bottom layer is opaque and all layers on top are transparent. Collections of pixels are managed as a special object.

Freehand is king of the vector apps. It really was so much better than Illustrator. Such a shame that it's no longer around.

Also interesting is how many early version of successful apps didn't support layers (Photoshop, Freehand) or transparency (Photoshop).

One small disappointment is that Macromedia Fireworks required won't run on this setup as it requires the PPC architecture.
