It started with breakfast. Unexpected plans were announced, and I offered to cut short my evening plans to accommodate others. My day at work was as productive as ever, I'd been firing on all cylinders for months and was in the sort of groove where you are capable of anything. I'd been working from my new studio space for a couple of months and life was good.

Later that day I arrived home to find the kids in a frenzy, unfed and far from being ready for bed. I made the kids some dinner and turned around to find the other adults had all gone out. The unexpected plans had changed yet again. During dinner and bedtime I felt a bit odd, and looking back I can be pretty certain that I had a breakdown of some sort this evening.

The following day I expressed my disappointment and unhappiness to my wife about the way things had gone, her reaction was to dismiss it and walk away. It was at this point that my heart broke and I knew that our relationship was over. I sent her a message saying if she wasn't going to be supportive of me then I would not be supportive of her, which in hindsight was not a good thing to do. She took the kids and left me for three days. During this time I was still doing some work but my mood and outlook were taking a nosedive.

We arranged to meet and talk it over, but as I wad driving there in our van its engine blew up and I had to abandon the plan and walk home. Later that week I was out with the kids in our family car and that broke down, resulting in us being stranded at home until we could get the family car repaired. I tried to get the van repaired, but the garage that agreed to do it changed their mind.

During this time, I was increasingly unable to work and missed opportunities to get funding to do work and another to travel for a work event. I needed to get out so I drove our small car, which I knew was not supposed to be on the road. I did this a second day, and was stopped by the police. The car was impounded
