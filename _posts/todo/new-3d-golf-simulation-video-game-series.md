Golf video games are one of my passions, ever since World Class Leader Board and Microprose Golf on Atari ST. These days my favourite games to play are still the old ones. Particularly, T&E SOFT's New 3D Golf Simulation series with its blue skies and bright colours.

## 8-bit

The series began in 1982 with リアルゴルフゲーム ([Real Golf Game](https://necretro.org/Real_Golf_Game)) for NEC PC-6001, a distinctly 2D presentation with overhead view, power bar and course map.

Things got interesting later that year with the follow-up ３Ｄゴルフシミュレーション (3-D Golf Simulation) which was written for the Fujitsu FM-7 computer and published in 1983-4 I/O. The game was written in BASIC and its source code including data for T&E Island Golf Course, a full 18 holes, was given away in the magazine as a type-in listing. The game was released commercially on a few other Japanese 8-bit computers over the next couple of years, with machine code gradually added to speed up the 3D processing in 1984's "High-Speed" edition for MSX and 1985's "Super Version" for PC-6001 mkII.

A break of 4 years should give you some idea as to the work that was going on behind the scenes, culminating in the 1989 release of Harukanaru Augusta for PC-9801. This was an official licensed representation of Augusta National Golf Club, also known as the location of the famous Masters Tournament. This is where the series really hit its stride and made lasting impressions: high resolution graphics using a bespoke dithering system to make the most of the limited colour palette, digitised caddy images and sound effects, catchy music using FM synthesis, detailed real life golf courses, and an engaging control system. The 3DGOLF system software was upgraded a couple of times over the next few years, and a handful of add-on courses were released. For PC-9801 the total list of available courses counted 6:

* Harukanaru Augusta (1989) [System Disk 1.0]
* Eight Lakes G.C. (1990) fictional course
* T&E Selection (1990) fictional course
* Waialae no Kiseki (1991)
* Pebble Beach no Hatou (1992) [System Disk 2.0]
* Devil's Course (1992) fictional course

Harukanaru Augusta and Eight Lakes G.C. were also released on FM-TOWNS and Sharp X68000, but not the later courses. Maybe sales weren't good enough? Harukanaru Augusta would also see a re-release as a "HD" version, running System Disk 2.5, but this was not backwards compatible with the previous releases.

The series was eventually ported to console, first to Nintendo's Super Famicom (SNES), with Harukanaru Augusta arriving early in Japan and Waialae Country Club being a USA launch title. Later, totally different ports were released on Sega Mega Drive, which was lucky enough to get four our of the six courses. Pebble Beach was released first in the USA and later in Japan. Harukanaru Augusta, Devil's Course and Waialae followed, but only in Japan.

These Japanese Mega Drive versions are my favourite of the bunch. They're based on the PC-9801 games, right down to using the same course data, and the user interface is a low-resolution facsimile that retains the charm and style of the original PC interface. They really are a work of art. Playing them today under emulation I make sure to overclock the CPU to reduce the drawing times and make for a more modern and enjoyable game.

Perhaps the box artwork is the most striking thing about the Mega Drive versions, with its classic typography-led design, strong brush-stroked calligraphic logo, and the intriguing hand-painted golf scene. These paintings intrigued me as they represented the real life courses. Further investigation revealed that not only did they show a particular hole but they also showed a famous event that happened on the course, with the obvious exception of the fictional Devil's Course. I don't have much knowledge of real life golf events, but I managed to figure them out using my Google skills.

With the arrival of systems capable of real-time 3D.
