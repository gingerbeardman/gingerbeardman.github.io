# History of Mac Software Houses in Japan

From the introduction of the Mac in Japan to the present day
- Kazuri Otani, MACLIFE November 2001 issue (No.159)

Japan is a country that loves the American Macintosh and has developed a Mac market that is as strong as the one in the US. Behind the scenes, Japanese software houses have responded to the expectations of their passionate fans by localising and developing their own software to suit the Japanese market. Now that MacOSX is 10.1, it's time to take a look back at the footsteps of these pioneers. Here, we revisit the history of MacOSX in three stages.

The history of the Mac in Japan can be divided into three main parts

The history of the Macintosh in Japan can be roughly divided into three stages.
The "dawn period" (1984~1986), when the Mac was first introduced in Japan and became a hot topic, but the Japanese language environment was not developed yet.
This was followed by the release of KanjiTalk, a genuine Japanese language environment, and the LaserWriter NTX-J, the first Japanese language Postscript page printer, and the "rise and fall" period when the Mac gained market share and business stability in Japan. Stable period" (1986-1995).
The "slump and revival period" (1995-1995), when Apple's lack of direction and the release of Windows 95 led to a loss of market share for the Mac, but the dramatic comeback of Steve Jobs and the success of the iMac and other products allowed the Mac to re-emerge and secure its own position. This was the "slump and recovery period" (1995-2001).
The overlapping of the years indicates that these transitions did not happen suddenly, but were gradual.
Some software houses have shone in each of these periods, and some have continued with a unique presence in every season. Let's take a look back at the past 17 years in a digest.

The "early days" when both users and software houses enjoyed being creative

Macs at this time had little RAM (128KB for the first generation, and from 1MB to 4MB for the Mac Plus in 1986), and each floppy disk had a capacity of only 400-800KB. This meant that not only was software development extremely difficult, but its distribution was also done at the last minute. Even Apple had not yet come up with a plan to create a genuine Japanese language environment.
Nevertheless, Japanese users and programmers who were interested in the Mac tried to enjoy the 'no-ware' culture of the GUI pace by using and exchanging the limited information and resources.
However, there were two software houses that thought that it would be difficult to spread the software if it was only available in English, and worked from different positions to develop the Japanese environment.
One was A&A, which released the Mac Japanese OS (later known as Sweet JAM) in 1985 with the idea of using excellent American-made software in Japanese. The other was Ergo Soft, which developed EgWord (later EGWord), an application with Japanese language functions that could be used as a Japanese word processor only while it was running.
The Mac Japanese OS was a product that batched the English system to allow Japanese to pass through, and although there were some quirks in the selection and deletion of strings, the attention to detail, such as the provision of a beautiful Japanese font in the style of Chicago (the standard system font for English characters at the time) so as not to spoil the stylish atmosphere of the English version of the software, created a devoted following.
Fortunately, the Mac OS had menu data in the form of resources independent of the program code itself, so it was relatively easy to change the appearance of an English application into Japanese if you had a Mac Japanese OS.
In addition, ErgoSoft made EgBridge (later EGBridge) independent of EgWord's internal kana-kanji conversion, and installed it in DynaMac with built-in kanji ROM, which was developed jointly with Canon Sales based on Macintosh 512K. The DynaMac was a unique Japanese Mac. This DynaMac was a business-oriented product with EgWord and Excel pandles, and Canon Sales, the sole distributor of Microsoft products for the Mac at the time, played a major role in the Japanese localization of the latter.
In this way, the Japanese Mac 'noophouses' started out by setting up the Japanese language environment for the Mac, but in a different sense, Arithmetic Hoshigumi, which paid attention to the high expressive power of the Macintosh and released its own clip art collection, Dennou Emaki, etc., was another software house that supported the Mac.
In another sense, they were the software houses that supported the Mac.

The "rise and stabilisation period", when Japanese word processors and other products flourished

Stimulated by these pioneering attempts, Apple also started to develop KanjiTalk, a genuine Japanese language environment. The Macintosh Plus in 1986 was the first genuine Japanese language model and was welcomed by the market.
However, after that, there was a gap between the English version of Mac OS and Kanji Talk, and heavy users who wanted to use the new features of the OS immediately chose to use Sweet JAM to convert the English OS to Japanese.
EgBridge, on the other hand, evolved as a FEP (Front-End Processor = kana-kanji conversion module) for Kanji Talk, and became popular due to its high conversion efficiency and ease of operation at the time. KanjiTalk had its own kana-kanji conversion function, but this was a bonus and not suitable for serious input work.
Thanks to the Japanese language support, Macintosh sales in Japan picked up towards the end of the 1980s, and software houses that were originally MS-DOS-based began to enter the Mac market. In particular, FEP and Japanese word processors were in full bloom, and by 1995, the following companies, just to name a few, were competing with each other.

ErgoSoft was instrumental in the spread of the Mac. After all, EGBridge and EGWord were very important for Japanese input. EGBook, the first DTP software in Japan, and EGTalk, a communication software, were also impressive.

Before the advent of KanjiTalk (the early Japanese OS for the Mac), many Mac users were indebted to SweetJAM (A&A), a tool for displaying Japanese on English software.

Tamazusa (Corsing Graphic Systems) is a word processor that is truly unique to Japanese software houses. The screen, which simulated a vertically written manuscript paper, had an impact.

Arithmetic Star Group's clip art series, which focuses on oriental materials, "Mac Shodo", which simulates calligraphy, and "Mac Pong", a mahjong game compatible with Netwok, are all very unique.

At the beginning of the 90s, there were many feature articles on the Mac Japanese word processor war. As you can see from the picture above, there were many word processors on the market, all competing in terms of functionality and usability. However, only a few, such as EGWORD and Tamazusa, have survived to this day.

FEP: EGBridge (ErgoSoft), MacVJE (Dynaware), TurboJip (Bridge), Katana (Samsin Ggood), ATOK (Just System), WXII (AI Soft)
Japanese word processors: EGWord/EGWord Classic (ErgoSoft), Byword/ZeroByWord/NibaiWord (Minsoft Japan), Mac Lite II (SystemSoft), MacWord (Dynaware), TurboWriter (Bridge) AIIScript (Maki Enterprise), SoloWriter (Mercury Software), Tamazusa (Corsin Graphic Systems), FlashWriter/WritePal (Catena), WaltzWord (Something Good), AssistWord (Assist) WordPerfect (WordPerfect Japan), Beach Text (Sogo System Service), Ichitaro (Just System)

Among these, Tamazusa by Corsing Graphic Systems is unique in that it was developed with the Japanese writing style on manuscript paper in mind, and is a product of the maturing Mac market.
It is also interesting to note that both ATOK and Ichitaro, which were standard products in the MS-DOS/Windows camp, were ported to the Mac, but Ichitaro's popularity declined while ATOK's popularity increased. This is another phenomenon created by the peculiarity of the Mac market.
In addition, it was the time when the creative side of Mac, such as DTP, graphics and authoring, was close-up.
In addition to the Japanese versions of PageMaker (Canon) and QuarkXPress (SystemSoft), Japanese DTP software such as EGBook (ErgoSoft) and SOLO Publisher (Mercury Software) appeared.
In the graphics/authoring field, in addition to standard software such as Adobe Illustrator (SystemSoft), Aldus Freehand (Canon Sales) and Macromedia Director (System 'Noft), SuperPaint (Sofel), DeskPaint II (Hulinx), KidBix for kids (B.N.N.) and nostalgic 3D imaging software such as Super3D (Sofel) were also localised. Amongst the domestic nofters, ColorMagician (Slease Company), which maximises the capabilities of Epson colour scanners, was also worthy of mention.

 The personal computer is questioned once again in "From Stagnation to Revival

However, after launching 16 different models in 1993 alone, Apple gradually lost its vision and direction, and the cost of that loss became apparent in its poor performance in the second half of the 1990s. At the same time ... The number of software companies developing software for the Mac declined and some went bankrupt.
On the other hand, the Apple-but-not-Mac Newton platform opened up new business opportunities for some 'noophouses' (although it was eventually discontinued), such as N4, which used UniFEP to create and promote a Japanese language environment for Newton that Apple could not.
Apple itself has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence with the return of Steve Jobs as CEO and the launch of the ground-breaking iMac desktop, but while mainstream software, whether Mac or Windows, has tended to concentrate more or less exclusively on Microsolt, recent years have seen computer users turn their attention to the internet and other digital devices rather than application software.
In response to this trend, Apple has launched its Digital Hub initiative, which is positioning the Mac in a new light by offering a range of genuine i-applications that are easy to use and have sufficient functionality for the average user. However, this has made so-called packaged software from third parties harder to sell, and despite the growth in hardware sales, Japanese software houses are facing a difficult time. Of course, there are a number of companies that have overcome these obstacles since the dawn of time by being innovative and guiding their users. With the release of Mac OS X 10.1, Apple is once again taking a step forward, and we hope that software houses will once again think outside the box and make a big leap forward.

A group of talented people with a Japanese sensibility

The world's leading Mac software company rooted in Eastern values

The name of the company itself overturned the common sense of software houses up to that time, and the company's existence was vividly burned into the minds of veteran Mac users by creating products that skillfully adopted Japanese traditional culture. Now it's time to find out what drove them to create their unique applications.

Macintosh was a life-sized computer

A computing star. With a name that sounds like a section of the Takarazuka Revue, this software house made a shocking debut at the dawn of the Mac in Japan, and has continued to pursue the idea of Japanese applications on the American-born Mac.
Dennou Emaki, Mac Calligraphy, Cyberspace Deck, Virtual Mahjong Mac Pong... These are just a few examples of the history of the Mac's ability to bring bitmap graphics, hypertext and networking to life through tangible software.
Why the Mac? And why the East? What was the secret behind the creation of a world of its own, turning its back on MS-DOS and the American orientation of the software industry? It was, after all, the passion of the staff involved. Hirofumi Inoue, who is still active as the president of Arithmetic Hoshi Gumi, describes his first encounter with the Mac.

Inoue: I think it was the end of 1984 when I first touched Macintosh. At the time of LISA, I felt that it was a machine on the clouds, but with Macintosh, I thought that a life-sized computer had finally appeared. But the only software available was MacPaint, and it was still a bit of an unknown what it could do.

At the time, he was working on software development for professional game consoles and game music, and he questioned the fact that various software was created based solely on American values. However, he was attracted to the idea behind the Macintosh because he felt that it was truly global and not exclusively American.
At the same time, Izumi Okano (now president of P-MEDIA), who later became one of the main staff members of the Arithmetic Star Group from its early to mid-period, was pursuing a career in editing, but living without a regular job because he disliked the seniority-based structure of the old publishing industry. As he played with the Commodore VIC-1001, he realized that a new era had arrived when he saw the Macintosh. At that time, the PC-9801 of NEC Corporation, which was becoming a best-seller as a practical machine, was also in my mind, but I decided to choose Macintosh 128K as my next favorite machine instead of 98.

Okano: It was fun just to tinker with the Mac. I went to Ikeshop and ADO Denshi before it was developed into T-ZONE. By the way, I also devoured the Macintosh-related review articles written by Mr. Otani at that time. The product itself hadn't been released yet, but the CDROM standard was just being finalized, and I was thinking about the possibility of electronic publishing using such a product.

Mr. Okano went to visit his old friend Mr. Inoue at his office and had a heated discussion about the future of information, which led to the development of Macintosh products by the Arithmetic Star Group. This led to the development of the first Japanese clip art collection, "Dennou Emaki". It was a collection of graphic data reproducing ancient Japanese images and designs as exquisite monochrome art.

Inoue: Even a single picture is not just a two-dimensional bitmap, it contains the spiritual world of the person who drew it. And unless you digitize that spiritual world, you can't really say that you have digitized the picture. With "Dennou Emaki", we wanted to convey the information contained in the content. But we couldn't do that with just the design of the software or the packaging, so we had to make up for it with all sorts of innovations, including the manual.

Hirofumi Inoue
（President of KYOHOSHI GUMI Ever since KYOHOSHI GUMI was established, the company has always been creating works with a unique sense of commitment. At present, he has six SOHO staff members and is actively involved in content creation as well as software development.

Okano: Mr Inoue and I were classmates at art school in our late teens. We were both greatly influenced by Hiroshi Aramata and Seigo Matsuoka, with whom we have been in contact since they came to Japan as temporary lecturers. Matsuoka-san was editing a book of art called Art Japanesque, published by Kodansha. It was an epoch-making book that went beyond the conventional framework of the Japanese art world, just as Apple had overturned the conventional wisdom of computers with Applell and Mac. It was also a time when there was a lot of excitement around the revaluation of Japanese culture. This trend and historical background led to the first collection of clip art in Japan. We also asked Matsuoka-san to write an essay for the manual.

Even now, according to Inoue, this attitude has not changed at all. Even in the recent Dennou Daijiki, the point is how to contain the contents that originally existed as old media in the electronic space. However, in order to make a product, we had to add a practical function, so we added a sub-function, such as the ability to make postcards. So we added sub-functions such as the ability to make postcards," says Inoue.

The initial Mac Shodo package was sold in a paulownia box. Of course, there was no precedent for selling an application in a paulownia box, so it was a bold idea.

This is the package of "Chi no Maki" from the "Dennou Emaki Series", a collection of clip art released in 1989 (1986). On the right is the closed state, and when opened it looks like the one below. This is another example of the unique packaging.

The word "Dennou", which means computer in Chinese, seems to be overused nowadays, but when Dennou Emaki made its debut in 1985, it was a very original name. But what had a greater impact was the name of the company, Arithmetic Star Group, which did not sound like a software house.

Inoue: We named it because we wanted to be a gangster in the computer world. The gangster was not Al Capone, but Ken Takakura. I imagined a gangster star in a movie, a little dirty but cool, and replaced the English word with Chinese characters. So the star is the star and the gangster is the gang. It's a bit of a complication. At first, I printed the company name in both Japanese and English on my business cards, but the impression of English was not so good in the US, so I decided to use Japanese.

So it was the star of "Kyokudo", not the star of Takarazuka. But at that time, it must have been no mean feat to set up a software house for Mac with only a small installation pace and to master it.
However, Mr. Inoue's answer to that was unexpected.

Inoue: To tell the truth, I didn't mean to set up the computing star group as a software house. Even before that, I had a premonition that computers would evolve involving everything, and I was aware that this evolution would not be an extension of conventional values but would destroy them. In other words, it was our role to make a shift in values, and we were investing heavily in that. So we thought, for lack of a better word, that if we could do it right, we could conquer the world.

In fact, the products of Koshihigumi were appreciated more in Europe and America than in Japan, but there must have been some difficulties in doing business and running the company in reality, what kind of role did Mr. Inoue play as a manager?

Inoue: A company is necessary to combine people who can come up with ideas and people who can develop them, and to realize what an individual cannot do. However, I myself was just acting as a producer to realize your ideas, and I didn't play a significant role. I didn't have any difficulties in running the company, I was just running with tension. I've always been aware of the need to balance the company and the fun stuff.

(published by ASCII), and "The Great Nature Library, 3 volumes" (published by Shogakukan). Since the Great Nature Library, his main activity has been the web. In spring this year, he started "Ikimononet.com/httpi/www.ikimononet.com/" (Shogakukan).

MacPon" is a mahjong game with the unique taste of the operator Hoshigumi. It became the company's biggest hit.

Mr. Okano, on the other hand, seems to have had the same idea of pizzazz.

Okano: Partly because I was young, I wasn't worried about the business side of things. In fact, we didn't really feel like a business in the first place. Even if it didn't sell very well, we were running with the idea of creating something new and something that no one else was doing.

In the midst of all this, Arithmetic Hoshigumi launched Mac Shodo in 1986. This software, which simulated the world of ink calligraphy and ink painting, was programmed by Mr. Inoue himself, and the package was made of paulownia wood box.
The following year, 1987, the company was the first Japanese company to exhibit at Macworld Expo Sun Francisco. At that time, even major companies were still in their infancy, and there were many small booths with only one booth.

Inoue: The first version of Mac calligraphy was very difficult from a business point of view, but it had a big impact and was particularly well received in Europe and the US. But in Japan, if you do something a little different, the first thing people do is criticise you. If you break through the stereotypes, you get a lot of flak. Magazines only looked at things from the point of view of user-friendliness and so on, and I felt that I had been completely poisoned by American practical software.

Admiration for Eastern culture with its superior information culture

According to Inoue, standard tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator are not really the world's global standard in terms of their ideology and realization methods, even if they are the global standard as considered by the US. For example, the Japanese saw cuts by pulling, while the American saw cuts by pushing. It is natural for Westerners to see information in its raw state through a window. But is this the best interface for the Japanese, who are used to seeing things through shoji screens?
Normally, these differences should result in different software for each culture, but in reality, the computer world is dominated by a set of standard values. The Arithmetic Star Group, which believes that Eastern cultures, including Japan, have always been more advanced in terms of information technology, has challenged and, to some extent, broken the ice. On the contrary, Westerners have accepted the difference more frankly and praised our products.

Inoue: We spent tens of millions of yen to make this product (laughs), so we wanted the Japanese media to understand our vision before evaluating it. Of course, we can't say that there aren't problems with products that don't change the attitude of the people who evaluate them, but we believed that if there was universality to it, people would eventually understand. But we believed that if there was a universality to it, people would eventually understand.

This led to the commercial success of Cyber Note, an electronic organizer in 1987, and to the HyperCard-based personal information management tool Cyberspace Deck in 1989.

Inoue: Cyberspace Deck was a project spearheaded by Okano-kun and Ikeda-kun. (They were not programmers.) It was the first such product at a time when things were changing from the days when you had to learn a programming language to make an application.

Okano●I was in charge of planning and editing, and designer Ikeda-san created the flow of HyperCard stack products at Hoshi-gumi. The launch of HyperCard was really impressive. The designers and editors had created the software. In addition to cyberspace decks, we also did exhibition presentations for events, and a recruitment stack for Matsushita Electric.

As a matter of fact, the major turning point in the management of the products of the Arithmetic Star Group was the "Virtual Mahjong Mac Pong" in 1991. At first glance, this seemed to be a step towards the secular theme of mahjong, but it was also a forerunner of network games on the Mac, and the fact that four machines could be connected via Apple Talk to play was revolutionary at the time.

Love of the Mac in plain language

In this way, the Arithmetic Star Group has supported the dawn of the Macintosh in Japan with unique software, but has its commitment to the Macintosh changed?

Inoue: Actually, I don't have any particular preference for Mac, but I find it easier than Windows, which has many restrictions. For example, the installation instructions for a Mac are only one page long, but for Windows they're five pages long (laughs). Of course, Windows is fine as long as you have a good development environment. But from a manufacturing point of view, I don't want to use a machine with a design that the creator hasn't thought about, so in that sense, Mac is the way to go.

The answer may sound a little curt, but the love of the Mac can still be felt in every word.
So what impresses you about the company's own products, or those of other software companies? We asked Mr Inoue.

Inoue: My favourite piece of software, and it's always been consistent, is a piece of software called Hendrix from Leeware. I think it's the ultimate software, because it changes the phase of the feedback as you move the mouse. With our own products, we've done the best we can at any given time, so it's hard to pick just one.

It seems to me that this is a choice only Inoue, who pursues the spiritual world, can make.
Next, we asked him about the current state of the Internet and the future of the Mac.

Inoue: It's a pity that Mac was not American at first, but the industry supporting it has been Americanized, and the industry supporting it has been Americanized more and more, and has been taken in by American values. It is a pity that the industry that supports it has become more and more Americanised, and has been taken in by American values, although there may have been circumstances in which it could not survive otherwise. I think it is still an advanced machine, but it has lost the simplicity it once had. I think that somewhere along the line, we went in the wrong direction. I'd like to see MPEG2 and the like left to specialised products like DVD recorders, and for computers to pursue their own potential.
As for the Internet, the distribution of content over the Internet itself is like an extension of TV programmes, and it's not particularly interesting. At the moment, it's still not being used in an effective way. As for the connection environment, it seems to have come down in price, but the priority is to promote it for amateurs, so to speak, and if you want to do something a bit more in-depth, it costs a lot. If you try to do something a bit more complicated, it costs a lot of money.

What are your future plans and what advice would you give to your younger colleagues?

Inoue●It's been more than two years since I released Mac Shodo Sansui, and I'm grateful that there are still people who support me. So I'm thinking of upgrading it in a different way, and I'll manage to show it to you around next spring. I've also been laying low work on the Hakkenden project, which I've been wanting to get done for a while, but that may be finished in about five years time. I also want to make a proper database system. But I don't think this is the time to make software packages, at least not yet. In terms of vision, we are talking about network applications. And I don't just mean applications for the net, but applications on the net.

So it seems that Inoue's next work will be seen by the public in a surprising way at a relatively early date.
Lastly, I asked him to give some advice as a pioneer to those who aim to do creative work using Macintosh and other devices in the future.

Inoue: People often say that ideas will run out, but that's a big lie. It's a question of establishing a system for generating ideas and being able to change it dynamically. Also, there is a tendency to think that the person who makes a large number of good, cheap products is the greatest, but I would like to see people have the spirit to make useless things now and use their impact to open up the next era.

Although they are different in scale, Hoshi Gumi and Apple have one thing in common: the seeds they sowed have blossomed into tangible and intangible flowers in various places. When and where will the next flower bloom? We will wait with great anticipation.
