## TV's TV

[TV's TV](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV%27s_TV) was a televisual predecessor to the book, a four-hour late-night program that was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from 01:55 to 05:55 on Saturday, March 14, 1987.

In comprised of 100 TV spots, represented as a wall of TVs, showcasing a range of video games from around the world. It introduced *Amiga*, *Apple* and *Atari* to many Japanese. [Toshio Iwai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshio_Iwai) (*Otoky*, *SimTunes*, *ElectroPlankton*, *Tenori-on*) did the CG using an *Amiga*, [Masaya Matsuura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaya_Matsuura) (*The Seven Colors: Legend of PSY'S City*, *PaRappa the Rapper*, *Vib-Ribbon*) did the music, amongst other notable alumni. It ushered in a whole new way of looking at TV, not only because it introduced Western computer and games to Japan but also because it was so new in the way it was presented.

## TV GAMES Denshi Yuugi Taizen 『テレビゲーム―電視遊戯大全』, or TV Game Encyclopedia 

This was a seminal book of video game history released in 1988 bang the middle of Japan's bubble-era economic boom. Perhaps there is no better visual representation of the type of excess that was possible, or even expected, in Japan at that time.

> Bubble-era

The book is extravagantly packaged in a frosted plastic slipcase and printed on a variety of paper stock. It contains a host of different print techniques, finishes, folds and—most obviously—the book is ringbound with majority of pages being split into three. This makes reading the book an experience like nothing I've ever read before. 

Pages are linked with references giving it a very game-like and fun feeling. To give an example of this: at various points throughout the book atmospheric photos of games taken off cathrode ray tube screens are spread across three separate panels, but the panels are distributed almost randomly throughout the book meaning that it's a sort of puzzle to be able to view the whole image. 

Imagine a hyperactive version of the choose-your own-adventure books, or a paper-based website before the age of the internet.

The name of the book is kind of strange in that it's named twice: first in modern katakana, and secondly in old Japanese. 

The content of the book is split into three main types: game history, companies & developers, and game titles. All of 1988's contemporary platforms are covered and the focus is worldwide, rather than only Japan, making it a who's who from the golden age of video games. The book contains the only known interview with more than one developer.
