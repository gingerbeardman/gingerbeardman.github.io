*Good news, everyone!*

For over a decade I've wondered if there was a 1-bit Hanafuda game for Macintosh made by somebody in Japan back in the day. It turns out there is!

It's called 花札スタック (Hanafuda Stack) and was created by Kenji Chihara in 1992/3 using HyperCard. YES! ✨🎴✨

I found this game in my collection of Japanese Macintosh Magazine CD-ROMs, which at the time of writing totals over 120 discs and almost 500,000 files. A real treasure trove of old software that I am sure holds a few more secrets!
