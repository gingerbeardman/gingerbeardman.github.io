*Good news, everyone!*

For over a decade I've wondered if there was a 1-bit Hanafuda game for Macintosh made by somebody in Japan back in the day. It turns out there is!

It's called èŠ±æœ­ã‚¹ã‚¿ãƒƒã‚¯ (Hanafuda Stack) and was created by Kenji Chihara in 1992/3 using HyperCard. YES! âœ¨ðŸŽ´âœ¨

If you're into Hanafuda, be sure to check out the [Hanafuda Discord](https://discord.io/hanafuda) and [Fuda Wiki](https://www.fudawiki.org/) where a fantastic group of people from around the world are building a comprehensive resource for these traditional Japanese flower cards. There are [rules for a multitude of different games](https://www.fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/games) (not just Koi-Koi), a list of over 300 [Hanafuda video games](https://www.fudawiki.org/en/hanafuda/video-games) and so much more. Come on!
