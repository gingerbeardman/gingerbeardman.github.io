*Good news, everyone!*

For over a decade I've wondered if there was a 1-bit Hanafuda game for Macintosh made by somebody in Japan back in the day. It turns out there is!

It's called 花札スタック (Hanafuda Stack) and was created by Kenji Chihara (千原健次氏)in 1992/3 using HyperCard. YES! ✨🎴✨

I couldn't find a single thing about this game online. My first Googlewhack!

According to menu system on the disc it came on, this game was the Winner of the Miyuki Oshige Award, the judges' prize in the "1st HyperCard Stack Contest" which was sponsored by Japanese Macintosh magazine MacPower Monthly.

## Where did this come from?

I found this game in my collection of Japanese Macintosh Magazine CD-ROMs, which at the time of writing consists of over 120 discs and almost 500,000 files. It's a real treasure trove of old software that has many more secrets waiting to be rediscovered!

## How can I play this game?

You can play it in your web browser right now at: [https://archive.org/details/hanafuda-stack](https://archive.org/details/hanafuda-stack)

Alternatively, you can [download it](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/hanafuda-stack) to play on your real Macintosh or in an emulator.

## Version history

This page refers to version 0.6. However, the DOS game HP-華時雨 (HP-Hana Shigure) from 1997 says that it reuses, with permission, the card images from version 0.8 of Hanafuda Stack.
