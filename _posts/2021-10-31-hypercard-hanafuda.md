*Good news, everyone!*

For over a decade I've wondered if there was a 1-bit Hanafuda game for Macintosh made by somebody in Japan back in the day. It turns out there is!

It's called èŠ±æœ­ã‚¹ã‚¿ãƒƒã‚¯ (Hanafuda Stack) and was created by Kenji Chihara in 1992/3 using HyperCard. YES! âœ¨ðŸŽ´âœ¨

I couldn't find a single thing about this game online. My first Googlewhack!

## Where did this come from?

I found this game in my collection of Japanese Macintosh Magazine CD-ROMs, which at the time of writing consists of over 120 discs and almost 500,000 files. It's a real treasure trove of old software that has many more secrets waiting to be rediscovered!
