I use [https://world.hoyoyo.com](https://world.hoyoyo.com) quite a lot. It's a forwarding service for buying stuff from Japan. However, I found that their website took around a minute to load a page, which became hugely annoying very quickly.

HOYOYO are great as they will negotiate discount prices from Mercari sellers, which has saved me a ton of money, so I wanted to stick with them.

Over time I'd resorted to accessing their website through a trusted VPN in either [Opera browser](https://www.opera.com) (macOS) or [Documents app](https://readdle.com/documents) (iOS) which both worked very well. But launching a new browser for a specific website always bothered me.

# It's good to talk

I was chatting with my brother about it and he said that he was seeing reasonably quick load times. After a little investigation I found that, for reasons I don't understand, certain websites are very slow to load through my ISP (British Telecom). At this point, it was obvious that using a VPN in a specific browser was overkill for solving the problem.

# Proxy to the rescue

So I tried using a web proxy and the load times dropped drastically, to a handful of seconds, which is a lot more reasonable! Not quite as quick as using the specific browsers, but good enough for me.

Of course, I don't want all traffic to go through the proxy. So I set up a PAC (Proxy Auto-Configuration) file to route only requests to HOYOYO through the proxy and leave everything else untouched.

In terms of which proxy to use, I picked a HTTPS proxy from the [Corona VPN proxies list](https://www.coronavpn.net/proxies).

# PAC, man

Here's what my final PAC file looks a bit like:

Note: you'll need to substitute a valid proxy IP address and port number, and host the file on a web server you can access from your device.

### Usage

- For iOS, you enter the URL of the file in the Proxy setting of your current Wi-Fi connection. A correct setting will be shown as "Automatic".
- macOS: enter it in System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Proxies, as below.
