I made a new game! It's a from-scratch remake of an original Java game, Wire Hang, by [Masaki Kobayashi](https://www.mobygames.com/person/510170/masaki-kobayashi/) (D2AC) who went on to become part of the Gran Turismo team.

I had a pretty underpowered laptop at the time, and writing my own version of the game was the only way I was able to play it comfortably.

My version of the game, Wire Hang Redux—made with Kobayshi-san's blessing—went onto to receive over one million downloads from early download sites like [Tucows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucows), Version Tracker, Download.com, Mac Update, [Home of the Underdogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_of_the_Underdogs), Game Hippo, [Hyper Jeff](http://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/apps?f=wire%20hang%20redux), [Windows Forest](https://web.archive.org/web/20040710054651/http://www.forest.impress.co.jp/article/2004/07/06/wirehangredux.html) (Japan), and even a little website called [Apple.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050302140236/http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/games/action_adventure/wirehangredux.html)—back when it had a download section! It was featured in computer magazines all around the world.
