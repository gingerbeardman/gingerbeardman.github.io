This is my Futurama-themed fan-game inspired a little by the Williams arcade classic Robotron and a lot by Jeff Minter's Llamatron. Written in BlitzBasic for Windows 9x.

Created in Feb/Mar 2001 during the dot-com boom and released in Jan 2002 after the bubble burst!

- Explosion animation by the wonderful [Alex Amelines](https://www.amelines.com)
- Sounds and graphics ripped from the TV show
- It's a 25-year-old free fan-game, you know?

Play it on an old install of Windows, or on modern Windows using [DxWnd](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/).
