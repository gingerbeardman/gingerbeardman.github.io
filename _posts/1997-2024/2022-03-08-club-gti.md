My [GTi Club: Supermini Festa!](/2023/06/07/gti-cub-supermini-festa/) obsession has bled into my game [Daily Driver](/tag/dailydriver/)... the "Club GTi" car features smaller wheels than the standard size, more roll during turning, and lots of detail and decoration to show off the rendering workflow I spent so many hours on. A good choice for the autotesting/motorkhana/gymkhana stages.
