This is my entry into the BlitzCoder Stupidest Game Competition, 2002. You need to guide a sky diver—whose parachute has failed—past obstacles and attempt to land on a cow. Fun!

It was written using BlitzBasic and later recompiled in BlitzPlus.

This is the game that made me realise I could make games.
