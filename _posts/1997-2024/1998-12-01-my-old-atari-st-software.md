I dug out some old 3.5" double density floppy disks from my Atari ST days and have made some old apps of mine available as downloads. These were made between 1992 and 1994.

- Paint (chunky pixel art app)
- REview (text document viewer)
- Chaos Calc 2 (fractal viewer)

Also included are some icons and Fuji Bar!, a companion app for the PaCifiST emulator on Windows 95 that allows you to easily manage and change .ini settings through a GUI. This was made in 1996.
