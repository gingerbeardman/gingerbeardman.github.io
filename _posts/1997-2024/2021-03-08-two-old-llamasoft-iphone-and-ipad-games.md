Back in 2017 a large number of games and apps were rendered obsolete when iOS 11 removed 32-bit compatibility: the appocalypse. At that time I was still downloading apps into iTunes as backups, and seem to have put aside these two great Llamasoft games. What foresight!

You should be able to side load them onto any jailbroken iOS device running iOS 10 or earlier, like an iPad mini (1st generation will be usable as-is; later generations may need to be downgraded), iPod touch (1st to 5th generation will be usable as-is; later generations may need to be downgraded) or similar iPhone.

I'm still hoping for an easy way to play these on modern devices, so let me know if such a thing exists!

Edit, 2021-09-13: I've added a decrypted version of Minotron that should be easier to install on a jailbroken device. 

Edit, 2025-02-06: I can't remember when exactly, but a kind somebody provided me with a decrypted version of Gridrunner which I've now uploaded to its page.
