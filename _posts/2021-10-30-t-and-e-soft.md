This is a Special Appendix that came with the 1993-04-30 issue of Japanese magazine Theスーパーファミコン (The Super Famicom)

This guide book shows tips for all 18 holes on each the four T&E SOFT golf games available on SNES:

- Harukanaru Augusta
- Pebble Beach no Hatou
- Waialae no Kiseki
- Devil's Course

These courses were also featured in games on other platforms so the guide has much broader usefulness.
