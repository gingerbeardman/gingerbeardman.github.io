I dug out some old 3.5" double density floppy disks from my Atari ST days and have made some old apps of mine available as downloads.

- Paint (chunky pixel art app)
- REview (text document viewer)
- Chaos Calc 2 (fractal viewer)

Also included are some icons and Fuji Bar!, a companion app for the PaCifiST emulator on Windows 95 that allows you to easily manage and change .ini settings through a GUI.
