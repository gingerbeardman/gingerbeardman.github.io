After moving to Windows PC from Atari ST I discovered Visual Basic and my mind was blown by the possibilities of laying out a GUI using the mouse and adding code to make it do stuff. I jumped in and made a whole bunch of Windows software, including some world-first features like hot-corners to invoke the screen saver and being able to select favourite folders whilst in the file selector.

I also made fun stuff like screensavers and [videogames](/2004/06/20/wire-hang-redux/), as well as more utilitarian software "apps". In addition, I played around with a really cool and very fast interpreted language called [Euphoria!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(programming_language))—whose claim to fame was that it had a reference-counting garbage collector—and I'm surprised to read that it is still around over 30 years later!
