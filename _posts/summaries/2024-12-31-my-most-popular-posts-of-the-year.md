2024 was a bit of meh year for me. A lot of time away from working, which was necessary but a process that I find difficult as I'm at my best when I'm creating. Here's to 2025!

Two viral blog posts dwarfed all other writing: [Emoji history: the missing years](/2024/05/10/emoji-history-the-missing-years/) (10 May, 15K views) and [Stapler: I remade a 32 year old classic Macintosh app](/2024/08/10/stapler-i-remade-a-32-year-old-classic-macintosh-app/) (10 Aug, 14K views) which heralded the start of me trying other things development-wise. I've created macOS apps, iOS apps, tools using Qt, blog extensions using Ruby, text editor extensions using JavaScript, games for Playdate, and I ended the year writing [a game for the Sega Dreamcast](/2025/01/05/dream-ride-for-sega-dreamcast-and-emulators/).
