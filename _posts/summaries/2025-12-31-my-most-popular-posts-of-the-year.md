2025, eh? *What a blast.*

This year saw an incredible burst of creativity and exploration. I started the year [shipping a multi-player arcade racing game for Sega Dreamcast](/2025/01/05/dream-ride-for-sega-dreamcast-and-emulators/), coded in bed [making games on iOS using Love2D](/2025/02/20/making-games-on-iphone-ipad-using-lua-and-love2d/), made a little game that [won at a PC gamejam](/2025/05/09/atari-jeff-minter-game-results-jam-llamasoft-and-st-format/) thanks to *Atari* & *Jeff Minter*, and created everything from [browser games](/2025/08/21/wormhole-for-perplexity-comet/) to [number one DJ mixes](/tag/djmix/). One big milestone was [my *Macintosh Magazine Media* project surpassed 1 million files](/2025/03/28/macintosh-magazine-media-1-million-files/) (that's over 30 million uncompressed files). *Nerd alert!*

The year also brought significant challenges—navigating [community harassment led me to step back from the Playdate scene](/2025/04/15/when-playdate-stopped-being-fun/) after nearly six years of creative work there. I decided to bang a drum about that and [I now donate all of my Playdate earnings to charity](/2025/08/02/donating-my-playdate-earnings-to-the-cybersmile-foundation/). This year also opened new doors: I landed my dream job to build a game studio and my dream game. Pretty cool.

Through it all, I kept creating, kept learning, and kept sharing. Still trying to launch [some apps](/2025/08/28/dottie-native-macos-pixel-art-editor-wip/) and games that have been finished for months or years, and that I use myself every day. Maybe in 2026.
