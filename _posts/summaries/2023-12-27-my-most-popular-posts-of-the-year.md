2023 was a year where I feel my blogging really hit its stride.

I've spent most of the year trying to comprehend 2022's traumatic events, the lingering impact of which continues to affect me daily. Positive outcomes are that it gave me a little more time to write, and I developed some small games that might not have existed otherwise. And one of those, [YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/), has [received a Game Of The Year accolade](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/7)!
