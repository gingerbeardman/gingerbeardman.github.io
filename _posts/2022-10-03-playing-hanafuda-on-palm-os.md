title: Playing Hanafuda on Palm OS in a web browser

I recently found out that it's possible to play Palm OS in a web browser, using https://cloudpilot-emu.github.io which is optimised for use on iPhone and Android, so you can use old Palm apps and play old games on your smart phone!

## Koi-Koi

I play a lot of video game hanafuda and out of all platforms Palm OS has three of the most interesting games. To play these games I carry around either an old Palm OS device (Sony Clié PEG-SL10) or an Android phone (Galaxy Fame Lite S6790) that runs an old Palm OS emulator.

So it's great news that Palm  OS can now be played easily on modern devices.

## Preparation

We're going to create two Palm OS devices, both in Japanese, and install the games. You could create English devices, but there will be issues with some text displayed in the games as they expect Japanese text support.

1. Sony Clié N700C (Colour, Japanese)
2. Palm V (Greyscale, Japanese)

You can source alternative Palm OS system files from [PalmDB](https://palmdb.net/app/palm-roms-complete).

## Support files

[Download Palm OS Hanafuda games and required support files](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b2obo97hlbb89n5/Palm%20OS%20Hanafuda%20games.zip?dl=0)

## Installation

Steps to play in Japanese, carry out twice to create one device each of Grey/Colour:

1. add new device and pick the respective .rom file
2. go through first launch setup and touch screen calibration
3. top right button to add the .prc files to device
4. top left button to reset, normal boot
5. launch and play the games 
6. switch devices using the Sessions button in the website toolbar
