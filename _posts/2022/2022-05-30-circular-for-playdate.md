This concept was a typical prototype: the core action came together quickly but then making that into a game took a while.

At some point soon I’ll write a devlog about the problems, solutions, questions and answers involved in its development.

I’m really proud of this little gem. It’s my first time putting a lot of effort into score balancing in the style of my favourite Japanese arcade games, and I hope you have fun trying to reach 1 million points. There are sure to be some surprises along the way.
