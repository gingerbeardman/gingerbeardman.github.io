I'm a big fan of the 1981 arcade game [QIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qix).

[Back in 2003](https://pyra-handheld.com/boards/threads/qix.2885/post-26563) tracked down the author of the game, Randy Pfeiffer, who had moved on from the video game industry to run his own business creating CAD software for model railway enthusiasts. I asked him some questions about the game and he was gracious enough to answer, albeit a little puzzled why anybody would want to know!

I'll outline a few facts here:
- The game is credited to the programmer, Randy, and his wife, Sandy
- Randy created the bad-guy, or QIX movement as a simple programming demo
- Sandy suggested making a game out of it, "sort of like video-game etch-a-sketch"
- Their eureka moment came in the jacuzzi with a bottle of vintage champagne
- Being a pretty successful silicon valley programmer, he did so for Taito America
- QIX was one of only a few games made by the US division of Taito
- The game was named after his car licence/number plate at the time: "JUS4QIX"

In all the time since the game was made in 1981, he said to me that I was the first person outside of Taito to ever contact him about the game. This was a shock to me, but perhaps I'm living in a dream world when I think that such a classic game as this should get more attention? But I guess the creator of Tetris didn't even get that much attention, the game stole it all?

After finding out this information I added it in various places, such as in the MAME notes for the game. This interview is the original source of the JUS4QIX and other facts.
