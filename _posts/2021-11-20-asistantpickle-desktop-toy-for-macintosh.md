AsistantPickle was a desktop toy by Thoru Yamamoto, released for Macintosh in September 2000, featuring a suite of tiny applications:

- TinyMemo
- TinySketch
- TinyPiano
- TinyWatch
- TinySchedule
- TinyEmail
- TinyAddress
- TinyClip
- TinyTimer
- TinyAudioCD
- TinyCalc
- TinyPrinter
- TinyLauncher (use the blue arrows)

It can now be downloaded at: [https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/asistantpickle](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/asistantpickle)

This copy of the previously lost app was found on Japanese Macintosh magazine *MacPeople2000 No.22 CD-ROM* which was recently acquired for my Macintosh Magazine Media collection.

An informational web site existed at [eggegg.co.jp](https://web.archive.org/web/20010203173700/http://www.eggegg.co.jp:80/tango/rbhp/pasist2/pasist.html) the text of which is archived. Images and additional files [also existed](https://web.archive.org/web/20020528060444/http://www.eggegg.co.jp:80/tango/rbhp/pasist2/data/) but they have sadly not been archived.

Thoru also created [PalmPickle](http://www.vector.co.jp/magazine/pocket/spotlight/030423/sl030423114.html) a similar suite of apps for PalmOS.

Pickle is probably Thoru's most well-known character. Pickle's Book was a masterpiece of interactive media, released for Macintosh in 1994 and [available for iPhone and iPad since 2014](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pickles-book/id794738212).

Note: the typo in the title (Asistant) is as it has always been.
