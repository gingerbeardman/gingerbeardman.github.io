System 7 is a great operating system. The experience using it today remains very close to modern macOS. It's surprising how little has changed on our Desktop in the 30 years since. That said, the experience can be improved with the judicious use of additional software.

When adding things to the system my goal is always to increase quality of life and improve user experience. Functionality is key and nothing is added without careful consideration. If I can install one package to add several functions I'd rather do that than add several individual packages. If I can install software to match modern macOS features or muscle memory then I'll do so.

Below are my personal choices that improve my time spent using System 7.
