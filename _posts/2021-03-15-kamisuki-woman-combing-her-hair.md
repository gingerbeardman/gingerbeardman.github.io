Woman Combing her Hair (Portrait of Kodaira Tomi) original by Hashiguchi Goyô, 1920. This work-in-progress by me, 2020–date.

My process involves both modern software (custom image processing tool & custom Portrait build of Mini vMac) and old technology (1992 Macintosh Classic & period Wacom ArtPad tablet, Deneba UltraPaint, Dave Theurer's DeBabelizer) it's such a zen experience.

A little more about the back story of this piece. I was inspired by [@SusanKare](https://twitter.com/SusanKare)'s interpretation of Goyo's "Woman Combing her Hair" drawn on the original Macintosh, featured featured at its launch, and later on the MacPaint packaging.
