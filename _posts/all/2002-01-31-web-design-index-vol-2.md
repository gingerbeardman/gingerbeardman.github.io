A couple of websites I've built: one for photographer Rankin and the other for my former employer Form, made during my time working for them in 1998/9, are featured in the book Web Design Index 2 and on the accompanying CD.

Compiled by Günter Beer, and published by The Pepin Press/Agile Rabbit Editions.
