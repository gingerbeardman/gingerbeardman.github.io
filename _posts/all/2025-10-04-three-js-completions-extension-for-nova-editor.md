I've released an extension to add [Three.js](https://threejs.org) completions support to the Nova editor.

The coolest thing about this extension is that most of the code is automatically generated straight from the Three.js TypeScript files. This means there's the potential for less errors in the data, and I can easily update the extension whenever a new release of Three.js comes out just by running a single command. Why work *harder* when you can work *cleverer*?

You might be quick to deduce that—yes—I'm making a 3D game. 😘
