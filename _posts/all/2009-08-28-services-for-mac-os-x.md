I created some Services for Mac OS X to do useful things on selected text.

- Calculate & Append
- Calculate & Replace
- Calculate & Speak

Edit, January 2026: over the following years I would create many more, most of which are in daily use.

> “The Services menu in Mac OS X (from 10.6 onwards) lets you use features of one application while working in another. The Services menu is contextual, so it shows just the services appropriate for the application you’re using or content you’re viewing rather than all available services. You can access services with a right click of your mouse or Control-click of your trackpad. You can configure the menu to show only the services you want, and you can even create your own services using Automator.” —Apple
