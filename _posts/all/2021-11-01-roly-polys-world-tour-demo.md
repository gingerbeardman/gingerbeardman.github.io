A previously unknown/lost demo of Roly-Polys World Tour (ローリーポーリーズの世界旅行) [aka Banabana's First Big Adventure] has been found in my Japanese Macintosh magazine CD-ROM collection. It was featured on CD-ROM MacPeople 1998 No.2 1.15 in a folder of product demos.

Creator Osamu Sato is best known for cult game [LSD: Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator) released for Sony PlayStation in 1998.

Thanks to both the Shockwave and Osamu Sato Discords.
