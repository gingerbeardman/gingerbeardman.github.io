Ceefax Viewer is a widget for Mac OS X Dashboard.

Ceefax (phonetic for "See Facts") is the BBC's teletext information service. Teletext is an information retrieval service provided by television broadcast companies. Teletext pages can be viewed on television sets with suitable decoders. They offer a range of text-based information, usually including national, international and sporting news, weather and TV schedules. Subtitle (or closed caption) information is also transmitted in the teletext signal.

This widget will let you view Ceefax at any time using Dashboard. You do not need a TV but you will need Mac OS 10.4.3 or better and an internet connection.

Click on the page numbers to navigate around the service. Use keyboard shortcuts for additional quick navigation.
