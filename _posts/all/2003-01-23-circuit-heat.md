I made a prototype of a game called Circuit Heat. It is a version of the classic network completion puzzle (aka Pipes, FreeNet, Net, NetWalk, etc). The graphics remind me a little of the Atari Lynx classic puzzler Chip's Challenge.

**Notes:**
- At this time, long before iPhone, I was playing Java games on a (Sagem?) cell phone so many of my concepts around this time were targeted at that sort of platform
- The game was was later featured on [PC Format 161 (May 2004) cover disc](https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/42140/PCF161DVD_05_04/PCF161DVD_05_04.ISO/Gamemaker/Blitz%20Research%20Demo%20Disk/DemoDisk1%20Files/Puzzle/CircuitHeat)
