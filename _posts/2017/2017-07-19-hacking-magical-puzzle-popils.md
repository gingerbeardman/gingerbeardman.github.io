Magical Puzzle Popils (1991) is a highly original puzzle game with mind-bending level design feat. portals and other cool stuff. Created by MTJ (Bubble Bobble) & Jun Amanai it is largely unknown as it is only for Sega Game Gear!

whilst trying to 100% the game, my friend Jamie "Junosix" Hamshere and I reverse-engineered/hacked/patched the game to make the step and sub-step count always visible. This makes it easier to beat stage targets! https://smspower.org/forums/16730-MagicalPuzzlePopilsGGHackHelp

I also discovered a few other previously unknown things: debug mode (step count preview, level select), alt credits, and most notably secret stage 0 that had only been hinted at in the Japanese manual https://segaretro.org/images/e/e0/Magical_Puzzle_Popils_GG_JP_Manual.pdf these are documented at TCRF: https://tcrf.net/Magical_Puzzle_Popils
