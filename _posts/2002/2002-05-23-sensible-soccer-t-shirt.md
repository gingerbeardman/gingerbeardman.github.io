I won a competition in a magazine that resulted in my design for a Sensible Soccer T-shirt being put into production by a company called Joystick Junkies. 

By early 2004 they were available to buy at online from the [BSI Merch website](https://web.archive.org/web/20031221003131/http://bsimerch.com/joystickjunkies/) and Amazon UK, as well as on the UK high street at all River Island stores, and to buy wholesale from Big Ben Interactive.

T-shirts were spotted in the wild as far afield as Canada and Australia!

## Design

It's a shame they didn't have the budget to do the lines along the shoulders and around the neck!

Eagle-eyed pixel-peeping viewers will notice that the final design isn't actual Sensible Soccer sprites.
