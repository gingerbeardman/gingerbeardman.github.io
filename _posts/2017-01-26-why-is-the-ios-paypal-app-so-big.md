The size reported on the App Store (204MB as of today for PayPal version 6.8.0) does not take into account App Thinning.

The [App Thinning](http://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html) process only delivers the parts of the app required by the device. For example, the launch screen for iPad would not be downloaded onto my iPhone; and the 32-bit binary would not be downloaded on a 64-bit device. For my iPhone 6s, the actual installed size is 131.7MB (see _Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Storage > Manage Storage_).

If I download the PayPal app through iTunes it is delivered as a compressed .ipa archive of 85.8MB. I can inspect this archive as detailed in another answer of mine: [What is the iOS url scheme for Appleâ€™s Numbers app?](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-iOS-url-scheme-for-Apples-Numbers-app) Doing so I can see that the extracted app total of 152MB is composed as follows:

The [GrandPerspective app](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) can also give a visual representation of the number of files that comprise the app and how they vary in size:
