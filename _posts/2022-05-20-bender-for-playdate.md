Ten years ago I made a web game called [Bender](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/227894472103563264) for the [AGBIC game jam](https://twitter.com/AGBICjam). It was powered by CSS transitions and a little bit of JavaScript. It was fun to make and devilishly addictive.

Since I started spending more time on itch.io managing my Playdate games, I’d been seeing a lot more of that old game in my list of projects.

Fridays are the day I devote to making Playdate prototypes and I thought it would be fun to make a version of Bender for Playdate.

I made it from memory, not looking at any of the old code, and it came together pretty quickly. So much so that I decided to see if I could push on through and release it the same day. The code is pretty sloppy but I figure it was worth it.

Whilst this game was made in a day, the design took a lot longer.

Here’s the result! Have fun.

The following morning I changed some things that I was unhappy with in the first version, fixed a couple of small bugs, and added some new things.

### Improvements

- Replaced launch card
- Using less fonts
- Removed flashing text
- Easy Mode!

### Fixes

- Largest bar size was never appearing
- Angle check now uses integers

### Download

Bender for Playdate is [available now on itch.io as pay-what-you-want](https://gingerbeardman.itch.io/bender-for-playdate).
