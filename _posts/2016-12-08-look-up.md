One of my favourite little touches in macOS: [Look Up](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25145)

And don‚Äôt forget that you can add look up support for Emoji symbols using my [Emojipedia Dictionary](http://emojipedia.org/app/). üòé

Detecting Data
--------------

On iOS (since version 10) and macOS (since 10.5 Leopard) there‚Äôs a feature called [Data Detectors](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25702) that helps recognise various forms of data in text, such as phone numbers, street addresses, contacts, and so on.

A simple version of this is the use of capitalised words as markers to detect phrases during _Look Up_. It‚Äôs not foolproof, as we can see in my video, but it works well mote often than not.
