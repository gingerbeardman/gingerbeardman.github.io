When rendering my vehicles I generate a single PNG containing all frames. Playdate SDK calls these image tables, or more specifically matrix image tables. You could also call them sprite-sheets, with the one qualification that every sprite has the same dimensions.

Given that these are plain old images they can be viewed easily. Showing a grid on top of the image makes the layout obvious. You can edit the image as a whole easily enough, but what if you want to adjust the size of every cell? Then we have a problem.

There are a few apps that can load image tables, asking for the cell size during loading. My favourite such app is [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) which has good options for import, editing, and export.

However there is another type of image that consists of multiple frames of the same dimensions: the Animated GIF. There are far more apps that can deal with this format, such as Acorn or Adobe Photoshop.

## Problem

How can we convert a matrix image table to Animated GIF, and back again?

## Thinking

We could use Piskel, but its GUI isn't the most straightforward so using it twice at separate points in the conversion process gets old fast.

So I had the idea of writing a couple of small shell scripts that leverage imagemagick and can be run from my Makefile, the command-line, macOS context menu, or all of the above.

## Solution

Below are both scripts, be sure to grab the Gist versions as they have error checking and "help" usage display.

### Convert image table to Animated GIF

[https://gist.github.com/gingerbeardman/b85367a8e6b3d139d9c85f49e146af38](https://gist.github.com/gingerbeardman/b85367a8e6b3d139d9c85f49e146af38)

```sh
# input file details
fullname=$(basename -- "$1")
filename="${fullname%.*}"

# extract cell size from filename
regex=".*\-table\-([0-9]+)\-([0-9]+)"
if [[ $filename =~ $regex ]]
then
	W="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
	H="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
fi

# convert to Animated GIF
magick -dispose previous -delay 1 -loop 0 $1 +repage -crop ${W}x${H} +repage ${filename}.gif

# output specifications
magick identify -format "${filename}.gif: %n frames\n" ${filename}.gif
```

### Convert Animated GIF to image table

```sh
# input file details
fullname=$(basename -- "$1")
filename="${fullname%.*}"

# convert to image table PNG
magick montage $1 -tile 32x -geometry '1x1+0+0<' -alpha On -background "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0)" ${filename}.png

# output specifications
magick identify -format "${filename}.png: %w x %h pixels\n" ${filename}.png
```
