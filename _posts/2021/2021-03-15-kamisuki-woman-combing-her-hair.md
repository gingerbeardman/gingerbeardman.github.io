Woman Combing her Hair (Portrait of Kodaira Tomi) original by Hashiguchi Goyô, 1920. This work-in-progress by me, 2020–date. First in my [1-bit Woodblocks](/tag/1bitwoodblocks/) series.

My process involves both modern software (custom image processing tool & custom build of a Macintosh emulator) and old technology (1992 Macintosh Classic & period Wacom ArtPad II tablet, Deneba UltraPaint, Dave Theurer's DeBabelizer) it's such a zen experience.

This piece will be for sale as a print very soon.

A little more about the back story of this piece. I was inspired by [@SusanKare](https://twitter.com/SusanKare)'s interpretation of Goyo's "Woman Combing her Hair" drawn on the original Macintosh, featured as part of its launch, and later on the MacPaint packaging.
