Samurai Mech サムライ・メック preserved!   
  
I've been digging up old Macintosh games, and this search has resulted in [the website for the classic Japanese game Samurai Mech](https://samuraimech.net) coming back online after over a decade! Thanks Ritsuko! See: [(patreon.com/posts/48174477)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/48174477)

Samurai Mech サムライ・メック is a Japanese sci-fi RPGs set in a future-medieval-space Japan. You assume the role of the eponymous Samurai Mech over the course of 40h of exploration/battle/puzzle gameplay.

You can practice your swordsmanship at the dojo, and upgrade your Samurai Mech suit with parts obtained through winning battles. The first game has a whole city to explore whilst you solve a mystery involving a group of ninjas.

In the sequel Samurai Mech II: Heaven サムライ・メックII・天 you are a bounty hunter in an archipelago colony at the edge of the universe. The setting includes an ancient castle, an amusement park, an adult ballroom, and a giant corporation. An all new scenario, more freedom, improved mech system, improved combat, and a choice of colour or mono graphics!
