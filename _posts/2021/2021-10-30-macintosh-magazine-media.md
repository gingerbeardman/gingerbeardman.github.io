For a while now I've been collecting CD-ROMs and Floppy Disks that came with Japanese Macintosh magazines for the sake of preservation of classic Macintosh software and games.

These magazines were released before widespread adoption of the internet, when it was tricky to discover new software and even more difficult to obtain it. Buying a magazine with a disc containing hundreds or sometimes thousands of files was an easy way of getting the latest software. Of course, more than twenty years have now passed and software that was once common has all but disappeared. These magazine discs provide time capsules inside which live many long forgotten secrets.

This is such an amazing treasure trove of files, containing many long lost files of both English and Japanese origin. The scatter chart shows the range of date coverage of the collection, full file listings are searchable at [gingerbeardman.com/mmm/](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/mmm/) and all discs are uploaded to [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman).

## Archive status report

The archive as it stands (updated March 2024):

*   date range: 1991–2002
*   total media: 425 discs
*   total files: 929,288

*   Fans of _Macromedia Shockwave_ and _Osamu Sato_ uncovered a 1997/8 [demo of Roly-Polys World Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlMzJs8Eb8Y) which is hugely exciting as the complete game remained lost to time (it has since been found, May 2023)

*   [AsistantPickle](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/asistantpickle) from 2000 is a more advanced desktop toy and suite of tiny apps by _Thoru Yamamoto_ (previously lost with zero screen grabs online)

My [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gingerbeardman) enables me to buy more discs to build out the database, finding more lost gems and sharing them once again with the world. I add missing discs to _Internet Archive_ and the _redump_ project and upload individual games to various Classic Macintosh archives.

Thanks for being on this journey with me!
