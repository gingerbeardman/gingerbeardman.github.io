Kururin Paradise is the Japan-only sequel to Kuru Kuru Kururin. 

To encourage people to revisit this masterpiece of a game I've put together a Translation Guide that should help people navigate the menu and understand what the game offers. 

I've also uploaded one of my Game Saves which has all mini-games and magic-tricks unlocked.

A full set of credits from the staff roll were also submitted to GameFAQs.
