I received a package from America: the 30-year-old manual for UltraPaint, Deneba Systems' Macintosh graphics program. It doesn't get much more exciting for me than this!

I love how the Option key in printed material from this era looks more like a 2-way switch symbol from an electrical circuit diagram than it does today.

## Similar Books

The contents of the manual are very naïve compared to today, talking you through how to use menu items and dialog boxes. UltraPaint (and it's follow-up artWORKS) was a sister app to Canvas. If you're looking for something with the same tone and content as the manual, check out Deke McClelland's [Canvas 3.0: The Book](https://archive.org/details/canvas30book00mccl) over at Internet Archive.

## Dear Reader

If by chance you have some old Deneba Systems software for Macintosh that you'd be happy to sell then please [get in touch](https://www.gingerbeardman.com). Specifically I'd like to buy copies of UltraPaint, artWORKS and Canvas 3.0 or 3.5. I don't mind what condition they are in, I'm sure it adds character!
