One of the most successful console games of 2016 has been [Rocket League](http://www.rocketleaguegame.com/). It features cars playing football (soccer) rather than people. Cool!

Some would say it’s both a surprise hit, apparently coming out of nowhere, and also a novel concept. A while go I was chatting with [Simon Hade](http://www.spaceapegames.com/about/board-of-directors/), COO and Co-Founder of [Space Ape Games](http://www.spaceapegames.com/), who made exactly these observations. At this point the game librarian in me couldn’t help but correct him, so I mentioned that it wasn’t novel at all. 😱

During my formative years I had played a game called [Wild Wheels](http://www.mobygames.com/game/wild-wheels) on my teenage crush computer—the Atari ST—some time around 1990, and I’d also played Konami’s [GTi Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTI_Club) on my Wii in 2010. Both of these games offer a take on car soccer, and I was sure there had to be even more car soccer games I wasn’t aware of.

On my way home I put together a list. I do love lists.

We can see that Rocket League is the latest in a long line of car soccer games, and the sequel of [Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Acrobatic_Rocket-Powered_Battle-Cars) from seven years prior. The earliest game of this type is from 1977 and there are at least a couple of dozen others between then and Rocket League.

The Secret of Success
---------------------

So what made Rocket League a success in light of all the preceding games? Perhaps it was a well executed online mode? But you could then argue that half of the games in the list also had online play.

The most important differentiator is that _Rocket League_ was released on the right platforms to target the right users. The trifecta of PS4/PC/Xbox One means every platform that is home to those “hardcore” gamers who play online seriously. In that respect I think of Rocket League as being more similar to FIFA than you might first expect.

Apparently there are signs of life outside of mobile after all.
