I recently created a Safari Extension that renders plain text Markdown files as good looking HTML right in your browser. I also added a context menu item so you can swap between the rendered HTML and the original Markdown text.

Download
--------

[http://www.gingerbeardman.com/safari/Doctor.safariextz](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/safari/Doctor.safariextz) (25Kb)

To install: double click the file after it has downloaded.

Why?
----

Recently my buddy and fellow Former Apple Technology Evangelist @[TDRBY](https://medium.com/u/35a6b2e3855b?source=post_page-----c19f3d74f728--------------------------------) asked if there was an extension available for rendering Markdown files in Safari. I had a quick look ‚Äî there wasn‚Äôt ‚Äî and that got me thinking.

On macOS you can use Quick Look plugins to add support for new file types to Finder‚Äôs Quick Look preview popup. These plugins are great, I use a bunch of them, but they only apply in Finder and not in Safari. Maybe I could do something similar?

So, knowing that Safari renders plain text files by wrapping them in simple _HTML_ > _BODY_ > _PRE_ markup, I thought that an extension should be able to modify such files. That was enough to pique my interest ‚Äî so I got to work!

How?
----

The extension took less than an hour to put together. This blog post took me a lot more time to write! Anyway, here‚Äôs how I did it:

1.  Create new extension using _Safari_ > _Develop_ > _Extension Builder_ > _\+ button_
2.  Set website access level to _All_
3.  Confirm extensions run on plain text files in Safari by adding a CSS file containing only _body { background-color: red !important; }_ ‚Äî success, they do!
4.  Find a suitable JavaScript Markdown to HTML converter [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) ‚Äî this ticks two important boxes: it is easy to use, and is still being actively developed
5.  Write a few lines of JavaScript to run _showdown.js_ on the page text and replace it with the generated HTML
6.  Add [github-markdown.css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) and apply the _markdown-body_ class to make things look better
7.  Configure the extension to run only on URLs ending in [common Markdown file extensions](http://superuser.com/a/285878)
8.  Manually add _https://_ variations of the Markdown file extensions to the _Info.plist_ (far quicker than using the Extension Builder user interface)
9.  Edit the .map file reference out of the minimised _showdown.js_ to avoid a runtime access warning
10.  Build the release package

At this point I‚Äôd like to mention a couple of great open-source projects that made this task so much easier: [github-markdown.css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) by _Sindre Sorhus_, and [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) by _Estev√£o Soares dos Santos_ ‚Äî nice work guys!

Testing
-------

There are Markdown files all over the internet, but two notable source stand out.

*   Almost every GitHub project has a README.md file. View the RAW version to have the extension render it as HTML. Here‚Äôs [the one I used](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primer/primer-markdown/master/README.md) for testing.
*   [John Gruber](https://medium.com/u/182e1a455da3?source=post_page-----c19f3d74f728--------------------------------)‚Äôs excellent [daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net) blog is written using Markdown, and the source of each post can be seen by appending .text to the URL. Here are [two](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/15/designed-by-apple-in-california.text) [posts](http://daringfireball.net/2016/11/new_touch_bar_equipped_macbook_pros.text) that I used to test. Of course, John is also the creator of Markdown. Thanks, John! üëç

Postmortem
----------

After the initial build, a period of testing revealed some issues:

*   Strikethrough, and some other non-standard but frequently used Markdown, was not being rendered. This was fixed by enabling some options in the _showdown.js_ file.
*   Rendering quirks due to using _github-markdown.css_ outside of the GitHub page structure required few manual CSS tweaks. Mainly this was to make tables look better.
*   Markdown on GitHub that was already rendered as HTML was being processed a second time, resulting in corrupted pages. This was fixed by blacklisting the _github.com_ domain.
*   Sometimes I wanted to see the plain text Markdown. I fixed this by spending an inordinate amount of time adding a context menu item that allows you to _Show_ or _Render Markdown_. I hope it was worth it! üò¨

Safari Wish List
----------------

Despite the brief development, I noticed a few quirks to do with Safari that I did not expect to encounter:

*   You can‚Äôt open the Web Inspector whilst viewing a plain text file. But if you open the inspector on a blank tab, or an existing HTML page, you can then navigate to the plain text file and the inspector will remain open. Phew!
*   Due to the way Safari Extension access permissions work, I have had to enable the extension for all pages and then reduce its power by whitelisting a range of Markdown file extensions. This feels like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer.
*   Extensions do not run on local _file:///_ documents. üò©
