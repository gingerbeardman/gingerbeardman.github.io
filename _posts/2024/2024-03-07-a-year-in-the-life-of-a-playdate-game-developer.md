This week sees the [first Anniversary Sale of Catalog, the official store for Playdate games](https://play.date/games/tags/on-sale). This means it's almost the anniversary of [the release Sparrow Solitaire](/2023/04/13/sparrow-solitaire-for-playdate/), which was the first Playdate work I did in 2023 after taking an enforced break.

So I thought it would be interesting to look back and take stock of the last year of me making stuff for Playdate. What did I finish? What did I abandon? What is still to come?

After Sparrow Solitaire (a huge game that took around a year of development time split between myself and Mac Vogelsang), it took me a few months to figure out the right sort of size and scope that would allow me to make a game every month or two, whilst minimising the risk of not selling enough. By September I was well and truly *in the zone* and [created YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/) which went on to receive a commendation from Ars Technica as one of the ["Best Games of 2023"](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/7). And at the [2023 Playdate Community Awards](https://play.date/games/community-awards-2023/), presented on 8th March 2024, Sparrow Solitaire won *Best Puzzle Game* and YOYOZO won *Best Arcade Game*.

Somebody asked me if this is my full-time job? My answer is: yes, this is my only job and I do it as often as I'm able. It's certainly more complicated, due to various life stuff, but that's the gist of things. Over the last twelve months, I would say I've been productive for around half my time.  

Recently I saw somebody say ["Be careful with scope and look what you can do in a year!"](https://twitter.com/indieretropod/status/1764443576597946593), about the wonderful [Johan Peitz](https://twitter.com/johanpeitz), and I think that addage can also be applied to my output this year.

**Summary:** 22 projects, 10 of which were released, and 5 are still to come. I'm pretty happy with that!

I also managed to squeeze in a couple of non-Playdate projects: my first real Love2D game [Portrait Curling](https://gingerbeardman.itch.io/portrait-curling), modifications to vintage pixel art app [JINZO Paint](/2024/01/22/jinzo-paint-vintage-mobile-drawing-app/), and I'm still [blogging](/).
