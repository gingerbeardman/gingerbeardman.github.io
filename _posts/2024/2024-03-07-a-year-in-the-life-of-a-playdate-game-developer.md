This week sees the first Anniversary Sale of [Catalog, the official store for Playdate games](https://play.date/games/tags/on-sale). This means it's also the anniversary of [Sparrow Solitaire](/2023/04/13/sparrow-solitaire-for-playdate/), which was the first Playdate work I did in 2023 after taking an enforced break.

So I thought it would be interesting to look back and take stock of the last year of me making stuff for Playdate. What did I finish? What did I abandon? What is still to come?

After Sparrow Solitaire it took me a few months to figure out the right sort of size and scope that would allow me to make a game every month or two, whilst minimising the risk if not enough people bought them. By September I was well and truly in the zone and [created YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/) which went on to receive a commendation by Ars Technica as one of the ["Best Games of 2023"](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/7).

Somebody asked me if this is my full-time job? My answer is that, yes, this is my only job and I do it as often as I'm able. It's certainly more complicated, due to various life stuff, but that's the gist of things. Over the last twelve months, I would say I've been productive for around half my time.

Recently I saw somebody say ["Be careful with scope and look what you can do in a year!"](https://twitter.com/indieretropod/status/1764443576597946593), about the wonderful [Johan Peitz](https://twitter.com/johanpeitz), and I think that addage can also be applied to my output this year.

Summary: 22 projects, 10 of which were released, and 5 are still to come. I'm pretty happy with that!
