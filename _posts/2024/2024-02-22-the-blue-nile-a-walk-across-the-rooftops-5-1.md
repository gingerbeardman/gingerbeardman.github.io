## 1984

In early 1984 Scottish band The Blue Nile released their debut album [*"A Walk Across The Rooftops"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_Across_the_Rooftops) including the single Tinseltown in the Rain. After 40 years the album is still regarded as a classic, and in all that time the band have released only three other albums.

## 2010

A user called `XTC343` uploaded some files to a USENET newsgroup: a fan made multi-channel "upmix" of The Blue Nile's *"A Walk Across The Rooftops"* album from 1984. The .nfo file said only:

> This is an upmix from stereo to 5.1  
> Done in Plogue.

I was so excited to listen to one of my favourite albums in a new way. I burned the DTS format 5.1 .wav and .cue pair to a CD and played it in a Sony Blu-Ray player. It was awesome! The album sounded more like a live session, with instruments and noises positioned all around the listening area.

## 2023

Anyway, lots of time passed, and one day in September 2023 I rediscovered these files in my archives. A quick Google showed that they had been forgotten about and did not exist anywhere else, so I thought I'd upload them to Internet Archive. I didn't give it any further thought.

## 2024

It's now February 2024 and I realise that I have a whole bunch of devices capable of playing multi-channel audio: my iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and AirPods Pro headphones! Time to revisit those files.

## Wrangling

Immediately it was easy to confirm playback using the original DTS format .wav and VLC app on macOS. But how to get the audio into Apple Music so I can listen on my device of choice?

1. use [XLD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/) and the .cue sheet to split the single DTS format .wav into multiple files
2. used [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org) to convert the DTS format .wav files into AC3 format .m4v files

Using a video container for audio content is a trick normally reserved for podcasts, but here it enables us to get multi-channel content into Apple Music (historically iTunes).

## Playback

You'll need some multi-channel capable listening equipment.

For the DTS .wav you can either burn it to a CD and play it in a suitable CD/DVD/Blu-Ray/etc player, or play the file directly using software (VLC).

For the Apple .m4v files you can drop them onto the Apple Music app and sync them across your devices.

*I'm sorry but I cannot help you with any of this.*

Have fun listening!
