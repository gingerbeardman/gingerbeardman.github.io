A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away I had to give an impromptu presentation about something I didn't know much about. The goal of the task was to see how well we could ad-lib a presentation under pressure. Everybody in the room had to think of a topic whilst waiting for our turn. The person next to me couldn't think of anything and asked me what I had thought of, I said "the off-side rule" (it's a football/soccer thing, don't worry about it). Then that person was called before me and proceeded to give a presentation about... the off-side rule. I was mortified, and when my turn came I was still so shell shocked that I can't remember what other topic I picked was, or even how the rest of the day went. Afterwards I chatted with the person—at the time we were good friends and continue to be to this day—who told me when their name was called "a haze of inspiration" came over them and the only thing they could think about was the topic I'd just mentioned. And so it was.

## From whence it came

Just as a haze obscures clear vision, the creative process can blur the lines between our own ideas and those we've encountered. We can be inspired by everything around us, in an unconscious way. I'd venture to say that this is the most common form of inspiration, you're just existing and soaking up as much as you can. As a result, we share a lot of common experiences and so this sort of natural inspiration can lead to the Zeitgeist, with similar ideas emerging simultaneously in different places. A sort of opposite to this is the concept of incremental innovation, where small changes happen to existing ideas that are enough for it to feel new. And then there are the types of new ideas that can't be easily found elsewhere, that are provably innovative and totally new. By definition the haze of inspiration is a very grey space, difficult to navigate, and open to interpretation. There's no absolute right or wrong, unless you are in a position to flex legal muscles. Below is my own interpretation of how I see things, it's expected that you won't agree with all of it.

## Navigating the haze

I often pause and examine my own creative process. This serves a number of purposes: it helps me notice opportunities for improvement that might otherwise be missed along the way. If my head is down, I might not notice that I can save time by refining my workflow, or gain new understanding from looking at a problem from a different angle or through a different lens.

Tracking or keeping a record of things you find inspiring is very useful. Some might use Pinterest, bookmark managers, scrap books, print outs, notebooks, folders of saved files. Whatever works for you, really.

At this point I feel it's worth mentioning the challenge of distinguishing between inspiration and imitation. We can all be inspired by something, but what how you choose to act on the inspiration can be a challenge. How much you take away from the inspiration might mean you cross the line into imitation. The difference between the two is open to interpretation, and legally it's a very grey area, so it requires understanding of our own moral compass. More on that later. But for me the difference can be summarised by how comfortable I am in the knowledge that I put enough of myself into the idea, then I'm inspired. If I don't put enough of myself into the idea, then I would call it imitation.

## Original thinking

Thinking can be difficult, and coming up with original thoughts is even more difficult. One could ask if it's even possible at all to have an original thought? I think it is, though it's often said that "[everything is a remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DX9RYuvPCQUA)". My personal feeling is that an original thoughts can only come when you take yourself out of the equation. Famous artists used drugs, alcohol, and more. Karl Wallinger of the band World Party (check out the album "Goodbye Jumbo") famously "[never worked straight](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/darko-audio-podcast/id1368388920?i=1000514052892)" (~25:30), he would always smoke a joint with the idea being "to get yourself out the fucking way". John Lennon, too, though perhaps with harder stuff.

On the other hand Quincy Jones used a technique where he would get himself into what he called "[the alpha state](https://www.clashmusic.com/features/in-conversation-questlove/)", a kind of liminal space between being asleep and awake, where he would routinely have all of his best ideas. Miles Davis used [improvisation](https://coppice-gate.com/film/402/miles-davis-the-first-improvised-music-film-soundtrack). Salvador Dalí used a technique he called "[paranoiac-critical method](https://mma.pages.tufts.edu/fah188/clifford/Subsections/Paranoid%20Critical/paranoidcriticalmethod.html)" to access his subconscious through fear. David Lynch uses [meditation](https://www.vice.com/en/article/david-lynch-wants-you-to-meditate-maybe-make-a-lamp-during-self-isolation/). Brian Eno used a deck of cards called "[Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies)" to add constraints to the creative process. David Bowie used a "[cut-up technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique)" (also called découpé), adapted from one used by William S. Burroughs but with much older origins, where existing works were cut up and rearranged into new works. My current favourite pop star, Lo Lauren, [creates songs in 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=infNIRbESVE&list=PLCu6QvIFB9Chc-pTB0tWnUv67ufwVz8zO&pp=iAQB) over a found beat using three suggested words to focus the topic of the lyrics. It's encouraging to realise that there is more than one method and that you can most likely find one that works for you.

My own method is to recede into the haze itself, into darkness. The simple act of laying down in a quiet room, and closing my eyes for a few minutes is usually enough for me to navigate through the haze and come out with an original idea, solution to a problem, name of a new product, or whatever.

## Research

For me, outside of the actual act of creation, this is most fun part of the creative endeavour. The world is literally your oyster. Given that 99% of stuff happened in the past, I prefer to consult historic sources. Old magazines, books, interviews, and of course the video games and music I grew up with are now old enough to qualify. Ha! The most important thing here is to look outside your field of view. It's easy to be inspired by the things right in front of you, but more difficult—and more rewarding—to be inspired by things further afield. Reach deeper, go further, get outside your comfort zone, take the road less travelled.

Once inspired, or locked on to an idea, it's important to do some due diligence to check that it's unique, or not protected by any laws or copyright, or even just to check that a name is free enough to be used. Domain names can be taken, hashtags can be already used. My funniest example is when I was originally calling my hit game [YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/) by another name: YOYOZORA, which is a combination of the words YOYO (the toy) and YOZORA (the Japanese word for night sky). I quickly changed plans when a hashtag search revealed somebody posting photos of their private parts.

## Attribution

By now you'll know in your heart if what you're dealing with is imitation or inspiration. What next? Methods of attribution might include: direct credit, "inspired by", footnotes, a mention, etc. Or if the inspiration is barely visible at all there might be no attribution needed. There's that moral compass again.

Attribution can add value to your work, as it shows not only are you compassionate and considerate, but that you value the creativity of other people. In some fields, like music and visual arts it's perhaps more difficult to do some forms of attribution. You can't put a list of credits on a painting or in an audio recording, but you can put them in supporting material. There's always a way.

> I won't spend much time on the topic of "AI", or to be more precise "generative tools", but it's worth mentioning them briefly at this point as they lack any method of attribution which of course is a problem. How big a problem depends on how much originality is in the result and that is a very difficult thing to measure, though I would say not impossible at least regarding the series of prompts that led to the output. Anyway, the results from the use of such tools is also open to interpretation and perhaps this is even more of a grey area than the haze of inspiration itself.

## Communication

So how do you figure out how best to attribute? By reaching out and having a conversation. But that's easier said than done, I think.

I've never gone so far as to write a formal letter or anything like that, I've been more casual about it. I've written to game developers whose games I wanted to port. Having something for them to see is always good—a prototype—and explaining the expectations and reach of the agreement will make everybody feel comfortable. There will surely be some anxiety and reticence around the idea of an idea being used by somebody else. In my experience I try to frame it in as positive a way as possible. Answer the questions they might have before they have a chance to even think them. 

Timing is always key. I always make this approaches as soon as possible. With my game Fore! Track, I contacted the developer whose game I was inspired by as soon as I had a prototype up and running. At that point, if they had have objected to the idea I wouldn't have lost much time. If I'd have contacted them with a finished game, it might not have made much difference to their decision making process, but I would have had more invested in it. Contacting somebody with only an idea for me feels like the wrong way to go about it, as ideas are easy and execution is everything.

With such discussions it's important to have open conversations, which will can lead to mutual understanding and respect. Leave your ego at the door and bring truthfulness, compassion, open-mindedness and you will be rewarded. Misunderstandings will inevitably happen through the course of the conversation, but by being open both parties can rest assured that there will only be movement towards resolution rather than escalation.

By far the best outcome of such open discussions is the fact that two heads are better than one so the solution is almost always better than the original idea or approach. This means it's in your own interests to have these sorts of conversations as often as possible. They might lead to better ideas, collaboration, partnerships, refinement, suggestions you would never have thought of, about turns, and of course rejection.

Rejections are always hard to take, but I'm a firm believer that with time, and enough water under the bridge, that newer and stronger ideas will emerge. For me that can take weeks, months, even years. But every time it happens I think "the Universe provides" and smile.

## Ethical considerations

So, about that moral compass I keep mentioning. Ideas are more than a feeling, especially when executed and turned into something tangible that can be seen, heard, played. They turn from intangible to tangible, and this process is guided by your moral compass.

When it comes to that "haze of inspiration", intellectual integrity is the needle on your moral compass. It helps you navigate through the fog without stepping on anyone's toes. It's about asking yourself not whether you could use an idea, but whether you should. It's about being upfront about what inspired you, maybe asking for a thumbs-up if you're borrowing heavily from someone else's work, and generally just being a decent human in the creative playground. By sticking to these principles, you're not just keeping your own nose clean. You're helping to create an environment where ideas can bounce around freely, where people aren't afraid to share their cool thoughts, and where everyone gets their due credit. It's like keeping the idea ecosystem healthy, you know?

Intellectual integrity is really just about not being a jerk with other people's ideas. It's about giving credit where it's due, trying to get your facts straight, and not twisting things to fit your narrative. It's also about owning your work, warts and all. If you messed up or your info isn't 100% solid, just say so. Nobody's perfect, right? And here's an important addition - be open to other viewpoints. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they're wrong (even if you really, really think they are).

All ideas build on previous work. I subscribe to the idea that everything is a remix, and I also know that being cool, kind, and considerate costs nothing. Being uncool, unkind, or inconsiderate can cost you more energy in the long run. Time teaches that particular lesson, so consider it being mentioned here a free power-up. We are lucky enough to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants, so it's important to not make a mess whilst we're up there.

## Personal growth

Growing is hard and with it come a lot of pains. Road blocks, wrong turns, bad luck, but hopefully it will trending towards forward progress.

One key aspect of growth is synthesis. Plants turn light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. The output is vastly different to the input. I think this is a useful lens through which to look at techniques for turning influences into something truly novel. You can look at the The Great Wave and print your own version of it if the goal is to imitate it as closely as possible (as [David Bull](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK-Wicsj5rAasS2g7e-Z9eFUdG6I7ZqED) has done), or you might choose draw it instead and replace the crests of the wave with bunny rabbits (as [kozyndan](https://shop.kozyndan.com/products/uprisings-poster) did), or you might sculpt it from (digital) clay and add some mahjong tiles to it (like [vxcl did for my game Sparrow Solitaire](/2023/04/13/sparrow-solitaire-for-playdate/)).

I like to think of this synthesis as a road—you can turn off at any point but the further you go the more wonderful the sights will be. I'd like to make a short detour to mention constrains and how they can foster creativity. Whilst the road might be long, it's not sprawling but a single direction. Navigating a complex road system would be much more difficult, so I encourage you to give yourself constraints if there don't seem to be enough or if the way forward isn't clear.

It's a fine balance between being influenced and being derivative. Sadly your moral compass is not fitted with a warning alarm of any sort, so you'll have to rely on you heart, head, and those of others to give you guidance here. Having respect for others' ideas can be considered a constraint in and of itself and can actually push you to be more innovative. Being derivative is a trap to be avoided, not only would you not gain as much personally from the endeavour but you might also inadvertently dilute the idea, brand, vibe of the originator. You should instead consider the person who has inspired you as a mentor, or team mate, a power-up, a voice of reason, or even a should to cry on. The important take-away is that they are there to help because, hey, they got there first.

## Embracing the future

With enough searching, or metaphorical travelling, you'll be able to find your own voice, style, brand, or "vibe" as I prefer to call it. I'm a bit of a hippie at heart. The ultimate goal is to find that rug that really ties the room together. Then cherish it, feed it, sculpt it, even defend it if the need arises. You'll have the ideas, make a [dent in the universe](https://allaboutstevejobs.com/verbatim/interviews/playboy_1985), and have vibe that other people will be influenced by, and hopefully they will take the right path and be inspired by it rather than choose to imitate it. Perhaps that's the ultimate goal? It's your turn to set a good example for those that come after you.
