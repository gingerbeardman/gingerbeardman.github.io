A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away I had to give an impromptu presentation about something I didn't really know much about. The goal of the task was to seeing how well we could adlib a presentation under pressure. Everybody in the room had to think of a topic whilst waiting for our turn. The guy next to me couldn't think of anything and asked me what I had thought of, I said "the off-side rule" (it's a football/soccer thing, don't worry about it). But that guy was called before me and proceeded to give a presentation about... the off-side rule. I was mortified, and when my turn came I was still so shell shocked that I can't remember what other topic I picked was, or even how the rest of the day went. Afterwards I chatted with the guy—we were at the time good friends and continue to be to this day—and he said that when his name was called "a haze of inspiration" came over him and the only thing he could think about was the topic I'd mentioned. And so it was.

## What is an idea?

Just as a haze obscures clear vision, the creative process can blur the lines between our ideas and those we've encountered. We can be inspired by everything around us, in an unconscious way. I'd venture to say that this is the most common form of inspiration, you're just existing and soaking up as much as you can. As a result, we share a lot of common experiences and so this sort of natural inspiration can lead to the Zeitgeist, with similar ideas emerging simultaneously in different places. A sort of opposite to this is the concept of incremental innovation, where small changes happen to existing ideas that are enough for it to feel new. And then there the types of new ideas that can't be easily found elsewhere, or are provably innovative and totally new. By definition the haze is a very grey space, difficult to navigate, and open to interpretation. Below is my interpretation.

## Navigating the haze

I often pause and examine my own creative process. This serves a number of purposes: it helps me notice opportunities for improvement that might otherwise be missed along the way. If my head is down, I might not notice that I can save time by refining my workflow, or gain new understanding from looking at a problem from a different angle or through a different lens.

Tracking or keeping a record of things you find inspiring is very useful. Some might use Pinterest, bookmark managers, scrap books, print outs, notebooks, folders of saved files. Whatever works for you, really.

At this point I feel it's worth mentioning the challenge of distinguishing between inspiration and imitation. We can all be inspired by something, but what how you choose to act on the inspiration can be a challenge. How much you take away from the inspiration might mean you cross the line into imitation. The difference between the two is open to interpretation, and legally it's a very grey area, so it requires understanding of our own moral compass. More on that later. But for me the difference can be summarised by how comfortable I am in the knowledge that I put enough of myself into the idea, then I'm inspired. If I don't put enough of myself into the idea, then I would call it immitation.

## Original thinking

Original thinking can be difficult. One could ask if it's even possible at all to have an original thought? I think it is, though it's often said that "everything is a remix". My personal feeling is that an original thoughts can only come when you take yourself out of the equation. Famous artists used drugs, alcohol. Karl Wallinger of the band World Party famously never wrote a single song "straight", he would always smoke a joint to take himself out of the equation. John Lennon, too, though perhaps with harder stuff.

On the other hand Quincy Jones used a technique where he would get himself into what he called "the alpha state", where he was awake but almost asleep, and he would routinely have all of his best ideas. Miles Davis used improvisation. Salvador Dalí used a technique he called "paranoiac-critical method" to access his subconscious. David Lynch uses meditation. I'm not recommending any of these, but it's interesting to know that there is no one method, and that you might be able to find a method that works well for you.

My own method is to recede into the haze itself, into darkness. The simple act of laying down in a quiet room, and closing my eyes for a few minutes is usually enough for me to see navigate through the haze and come out with an original idea, solution to a problem, name for a product, or whatever.

## Research

For me this is, outside of actual creation, most fun aspect of the creative endeavour. The world is literally your oyster. Given that 99% of stuff happened in the past, I prefer to consult historic sources. Old magazines, books, interviews, and of course the video games and music I grew up with are now old enough to qualify. Ha!

Once inspired, or locked on to an idea, you should do some due diligence to check that it's unique, or not protected by any laws or copyright, or even just to check that a name is free enough to be used. Domain names can be taken, hashtags can be already used. Famously I was originally calling my hit game YOYOZO by another name: YOYOZORA, which is a combintion of the word YOYO and YOZORA the Japanese word for night sky. I quickly changed plans when a hashtag search revealed somebody posting dodgy photos with the hashtag.

## Attribution

By now you'll know in your heart if what you're dealing with is immitation or inspiration. What next? Methods of attribution might inclide: direct credit, "inspired by", footnotes, a mention, etc. Or if the inspiration is barely visible at all there might be no attribution needed. There's that moral compass again.

Attribution can add value to your work, as it shows not only are you compassionate and considerate, but that you value the creativity of other people. In some fields, like music and visual arts it's perhaps more difficult to do some forms of attribution. You can't put a list of credits on a painting or in an audio recording, but you can put them in supporting material. There's always a way.

## Communication

So how do you figure out how best to attribute? By reaching out. Easier said than done.

I've never gone so far as to write a formal letter or anything like that, I've been more casual about it. I've written to game developers whose games I wanted to port. Having something for them to see is always good, and explaining the expectations and reach of the agreement will make everybody feel comfortable. There will surely be some anxiety and reticence around the idea of your idea being used by somebody else. In my experience I try to frame it in as positive a way as possible. Answer the questions they might have before they have a chance to even think them. 

Timing is always key. I always make this approaches as soon as possible. With my game Fore! Track, I contacted the developer whose game I was inspired by as soon as I had a prototype up and running. At that point, if they had have objected to the idea I wouldn't have lost much time. If I'd have contacted them with a finished game, it might not have made much difference to their decision making process, but I would have had more invested in it. Contacting somebody with only an idea for me feels like the wrong way to go about it, as ideas are easy and execution is everything.

With such discussions it's important to have open conversations, which will can lead to mutual understanding and respect. Leave your ego at the door and bring truthfulness, compassion, open-mindedness and you will be rewarded. Misunderstandings will inevitably happen through the course of the conversation, but by being open both parties can rest assured that there will only be movement towards resolution rather than escalation.

By far the best outcome of such open discussions is the fact that two heads are better than one so the solution is almost always better than the original idea or approach. This means it's in your own interests to have these sorts of conversations as often as possible. They might lead to better ideas, collaboration, partnerships, refinement, suggestions you would never have thought of, about turns, and of course rejection.

Rejections are always hard to take, but I'm a firm believer that with time, and enough water under the bridge, that newer and stronger ideas will emerge. For me that can take weeks, months, even years. But every time it happens I think "the Universe provides" and smile.

## Ethical considerations

So, about that moral compass I keep mentioning. Ideas are more than a feeling, especially when executed and turned into something tangible that can be seen, heard, played.

When it comes to that "haze of inspiration", intellectual integrity is the needle on your moral compass. It helps you navigate through the fog without stepping on anyone's toes. It's about being upfront about what inspired you, maybe asking for a thumbs-up if you're borrowing heavily from someone else's work, and generally just being a decent human in the creative playground. By sticking to these principles, you're not just keeping your own nose clean. You're helping to create an environment where ideas can bounce around freely, where people aren't afraid to share their cool thoughts, and where everyone gets their due credit. It's like keeping the idea ecosystem healthy, you know?

Intellectual integrity is really just about not being a jerk with other people's ideas. It's about giving credit where it's due, trying to get your facts straight, and not twisting things to fit your narrative. It's also about owning your work, warts and all. If you messed up or your info isn't 100% solid, just say so. Nobody's perfect, right? And here's an important addition - be open to other viewpoints. Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they're wrong (even if you really, really think they are).

All ideas build on previous work. I subscribe to the idea that everything is a remix, and I also know that being cool, kind, and considerate costs nothing. Being uncool, unkind, or unconsiderate can cost you more energy in the long run. Time teaches that particular lesson, so consider it being mentioned here a free power-up. We are lucky enough to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants, so it's important to not make a mess whilst we're up there.

## Personal growth

Growing is hard and with it come a lot of pains. Road blocks, wrong turns, bad luck, but hopefully it will trending towards forward progress.

One aspect of growth is synthesis. Plants turn light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. The output is vastly different to the input. I think this is a useful lens through which to look at techniques for turning influences into something truly novel. You can look at the The Great Wave and print your own version of it if the goal is to immitate it as closely as possible LINK, or you might draw it instead and replace the wave with rabbits, or you might sculpt it from (digital) clay and add some mahjong tiles to it. I like to think of this synthesis as a road—you can turn off at any point but the further you go the more wonderful the sights will be. I'd like to make a short detour to mention constrains and how they can foster creativity. Whilst the road might be long, it's not sprawling but a single direction. Navigating a complex road system would be much more difficuly, so I encourage you to give yourself constraints if there don't seem to be enough or if the way forward isn't clear.

It's a fine balance between being influenced and being derivative. Sadly your moral compass is not fitted with a speaker of any sort, so you'll have to rely on you heart, head, and those of others to give you guidance here.Having respect for others' ideas can be considered a constraint in and of itself and can actually push you to be more innovative. Being deriviative is a trap to be avoided, not only would you not gain as much personally from the endeavour but you might also inadvertantly dilute the idea, brand, vibe of the originator. You should instead consider the person who has inspired you as a mentor, or team mate, a power-up, a voice of reason, or even a should to cry on. The important take-away is that they are there to help because, hey, they got there first.

## Embracing the future

With enough searching, or metaphorical travelling, you'll be able to find your own voice, style, brand, or "vibe" as I prefer to call it. I'm a bit of a hippie at heart. The ultimate goal is to find that rug that really ties the room together. You'll have the ideas and vibe that other people will be influenced by, and hopefully they will take the right path and be inspired by it rather than choose to immitate it. Perhaps that's the ultimate goal?
