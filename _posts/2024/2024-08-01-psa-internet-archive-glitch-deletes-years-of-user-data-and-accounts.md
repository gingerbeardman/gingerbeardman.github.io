Recently at Internet Archive a "glitch" ([their choice of word](https://archive.org/post/2435138/archives-removed-my-account-and-deleted-all-my-uploaded-files)) deleted a great many accounts, including my account that had been at [https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman](https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman) since 2015.

Somewhat surprisingly, they are not reaching out to affected users but rather waiting for them to create new accounts and silently relinking their old uploads *only if the new account has same email as the old account*. Otherwise, all profile metadata, favourites, lists, reviews, posts, collections, web archives, and the original username are not being relinked. For me that's a decade of data...gone.

The main impact of this massive data loss, that happened around mid-July, is that there are now dead links to old profiles and various old pages all across the internet, plus the additional impact of lost data that is not being recovered. It's a real blow to the broader preservation effort to know that *the one place where data is supposed to be safe forever has had a massive data loss* and the organisation responsible are not taking proactive steps to address the issue fully.

The extent of the data loss and how many accounts were affected is currently unknown. And because they're not really talking about it, it's quite difficult to find any concrete information as to the extent or cause of the data loss. You can find [more info at the Internet Archive forums](https://archive.org/iathreads/forum-display.php?forum=general), [the /r/internetarchive subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetarchive/s/YFihAFXzE8), or your choice of social media where Internet Archive have a presence (Twitter: [ref1](https://twitter.com/search?q=login%20to%3Ainternetarchive&src=typed_query&f=live), [ref2](https://twitter.com/search?q=account%20to%3Ainternetarchive&src=typed_query&f=live)).

This story is still developing, and the press have been notified.

## Support, up to a point

My support experience with Internet Archive was frustrating and ultimately futile. They did not adequately address my queries and requests. Instead they made changes to my account that I did not request, and in the end were pretty clear that they were not going to help me any further. This is such a disappointing stance to take with users who are simply trying to recover their data as a result of loss caused by Internet Archive itself.
