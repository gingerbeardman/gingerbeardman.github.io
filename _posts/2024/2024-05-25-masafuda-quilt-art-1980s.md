I came across Masafusa Shibuya 渋谷正房 when looking through [Designers' Workshop](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/1748028717186650244) (1983), a three volume series from 別冊美術手帖 (quarterly art magazine bessatsu bijutsu techo). When I'm looking through old magazines like this I generally go armed with Google Translate camera mode, for rough translations, and bookmark a bunch of things to revisit or write about later. I saw his beautiful "quilt art" キルトアート and added a bookmark.

A couple of months passed and I sat down to watch [Poor Things]() and I don't make it past the opening title sequence. But why? Well, it was because of Masafusa Shibuya.

There's precious little on the internet about Masafusa Shibuya, I guess because they were active in the early 1980s and everything pre-internet can appear to be "lost" to a degree. Especially to Westerners interested in Japan as their strict copyright laws mean that you need to visit libraries in person to read this stuff. Or, you can be like me and import old books.

Previous mentions seem to be from people like me reading old books. 

Ace Hotel Blog found some in Fabric and Needlework Illustration, 1994.

As well as the beautiful satin jackets, the artwork featuring on the covers of music albums and cookery books, in books on fabric and needlework or quilt art, and books on illustration like the JCA Annual 4 (1984).

By no means the only quilt artist at the time, and not even the only one doing landscapes. Issue 53 of Japanese magazine Illustration イラストレーション featured Masafusa Shibuya 渋谷正房, Miyuki Sakai さか井みゆき, Yoshiyuki Fukuoka 福岡義之, Noriko Kumazawa くまざわのりこ, Keiko Nishizawa 西沢啓子.
