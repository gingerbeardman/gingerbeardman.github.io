Sharp's Denshi Techō (電子手帳) were a range of electronic notebooks or organisers, marketed as [Bware](https://www.g-mark.org/gallery/winners/9cad4b2a-803d-11ed-862b-0242ac130002) in Japan and [Wizard or IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Wizard) elsewhere. In Japan they won a prestigious [G-mark Good Design Award in 1988](https://www.g-mark.org/gallery/winners/9cad4b2a-803d-11ed-862b-0242ac130002) and in the USA [an episode of Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_(Seinfeld)) was the prize.

As well as being [home to some of the earliest emoji](/2024/05/10/emoji-history-the-missing-years/) these devices could run software from IC cards (solid state storage). There were about 30 games released in this format, everything from classics like *Sokoban*, *Shanghai*, *Lode Runner*, *Puzznic*, *Fortress*, to everygreen games like *Golf*, *Baseball*, *Mahjong*, *Shogi*, *Othello*, *Solitaire*, *President* (card game), exclusive games like *Yamamura Misa Suspense – The Kyoto Zai-tech Murder Case*, and some contemporary titles like *Hatris*.

And perhaps most importantly: a version of *Tetris*, released in December 1989. [Tetris-mania was in full effect](/2024/06/18/tetris-heavenly-scrolls/) and the *Game Boy* had recently received its version of *Tetris* in April 1989.

There's not much about these devices online, particularly in English, but two notable places are: [HP Museum forum](https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-16524.html) (for devices and IC cards) and [Insert Credit forum](https://forums.insertcredit.com/t/stay-sharp-with-sc-denshi-system-techo-games/2326) (for games). The devices are common on Japanese auction and selling websites, but the games are becoming more difficult to find.

> Thanks to [Akuji](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldHandhelds/comments/sr51ze/may_i_present_you_the_whole_family_of_sharp/), the collector from whom I bought my Sharp PA-8500 and manual, who is a fountain of knowledge regarding IC-capable devices from a range of manufacturers.

## TETRIS

Here's the Tetris IC card running on my PA-8500:

## Analysis

This version of the game is documented only briefly on [Tetris.wiki](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_(Sharp_Wizard)) and even less on [Hard Drop Tetris Wiki](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_(Sharp_Wizard)), so let's see what we can do to fill in a bit more information.

The device boots straight into the game, but you can switch to calendar, memo, calculator, or other organiser functions whilst it is running. Switching back to the game causes it to reboot, so games cannot be resumed. You cannot skip the BPS logo, but you can skip the credits.

There is a touch screen surface on top of where the card slots in and the print on the IC card itself shows the user where to press for each button or function. We can see that the shape of each buttons lines up with the grid of dots of the touch surface. We see the following buttons:

- left
- right
- rotate (only counter-clockwise)
- soft drop
- start (hi-speed)
- start (low-speed)
- pause on/off
- sound on/off

Scoring, line-clearing, leveling-up are somewhat odd and non-standard. [Tetris.wiki](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_(Sharp_Wizard)) has those covered. Notably, the play area reduces in size by the bottom lines filling in as you level-up, gradually becoming less tall and more cramped.

The game seems to have been programmed by BPS (Bullet-Proof Software), though I'm yet to see the manual, but there are no separate programming credits. <!--Perhaps the game code or chips would contain more information.-->
