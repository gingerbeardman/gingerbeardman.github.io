I'm a big believer in solving problems yourself if it's possible rather than waiting for app updates that might never arrive. Making extensions for the [Nova editor](https://nova.app) that I do most of my programming and blogging in is so much fun! So,¬†here are some of my own creation:

----

## YAML Tag Picker

Allows you to easily select tags for the front matter in your blog posts. It scans your existing posts for tags and presents them in a Choice Palette, making it easy to maintain consistent tagging across your blog. Nice!

## Markdown File Linker

Allows you to insert links to local files as Markdown, perfect for linking between articles in your Jekyll blog! Also includes the ability to wrap the current text in a link, and if there's a URL on the clipboard that'll be used as the link destination.

[extensions.panic.com/extensions/com.gingerbeardman/com.gingerbeardman.MarkdownFileLinker/](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/com.gingerbeardman/com.gingerbeardman.MarkdownFileLinker/)

You choose a local file using the file selector, such as:

- `/Users/matt/Projects/blog/_posts/2023/2023-11-21-yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb.md`

And it will be inserted as:

- `/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/`

If you've selected some text before invoking the extension, you'll get:

- `[YOYOZO](/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/)`

For an image you might end up with:

- `![IMG](‚àïimages/posts/yoyozo-teaser.gif)`

## Reindent-o-matic

Allows you to apply `.editorconfig` indent rules to the current file, or all files matching specific extensions. Important: changes are applied but not saved, giving you the opportunity to review.

 Useful when reusing code from one project that used space indentation to a new one that uses tab indentation. Ideally Nova should do this automatically, and sometimes it does, but not every time for reasons I can't figure out.

## Toggle Scroll Bars

Allows you to see the scrollbar at all times. This is useful because the scrollbar also contains source control change markers. With scrollbars always visible you can more easily locate changes across the entire length of your document.

This has already saved me so much time and effort and I've only been using the editor this way for a few a week. So I thought I'd create an extension to make it easier for other people to enjoy this usability improvement.

## Unwrap Paragraph

OK, I got carried away. This one adds the ability to merge multiple lines of selected text into one.

This is useful for combining multiple lines of data into one, or reflowing a paragraph of text that has had manual line breaks applied such as something pasted from an old email. It also colalesces areas of white space into a single space. So, it's not just "Join Lines" but something more specific.

In the _TextMate_ editor this command is called Unwrap Paragraph, so I've kept the same name.
