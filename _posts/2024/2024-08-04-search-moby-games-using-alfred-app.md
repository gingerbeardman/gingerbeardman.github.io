Earlier this year I made a workflow for [Alfred app](https://alfred.app) to allow easy searching of [Moby Games](https://www.mobygames.com).

This week it was released on [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app/workflows/gingerbeardman/moby-games/).

Grab it here: [https://alfred.app/workflows/gingerbeardman/moby-games/](https://alfred.app/workflows/gingerbeardman/moby-games/)

It requires an [API that you can get instantly](https://www.mobygames.com/info/api/) with minimal hassle via your Moby Games profile page.

Suggestions and PRs are welcome at: [https://github.com/gingerbeardman/alfred-moby-games/](https://github.com/gingerbeardman/alfred-moby-games/)
