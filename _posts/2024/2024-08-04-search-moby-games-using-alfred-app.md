Earlier this year I made a workflow for [Alfred app](https://alfred.app) to allow easy searching of [Moby Games](https://www.mobygames.com). Earlier this week it was released on [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app/workflows/gingerbeardman/moby-games/).

The workflow [requires an API key that you can get instantly](https://www.mobygames.com/info/api/) via your Moby Games profile page.

> If you'd like access to the free API (not-for-profit use), create a MobyGames account and then visit your profile page. Click the 'API' link under your user name to sign up for an API key. If you wish to use the API key with an existing game launcher or plugin please specify which launcher and plugin you will be using.

Enter "Alfred app Moby Games workflow". Then paste your API into the Workflow configuration.
