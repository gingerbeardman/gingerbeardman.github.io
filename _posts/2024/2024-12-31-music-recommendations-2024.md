Initially I had thought this year wasn't as good as last year in terms of music, but listening again to the best tracks from the first 40-something weeks of the year proved otherwise. It was a great year.

Most music I was sent by the Apple Music algorithm continued to be Japanese, thanks to my ongoing deep dive. During the initial playlist curation I was struck by a fairly clean divide of dance and not-dance. I was also still listening to [Soichi Terada's Essential Mix](https://www.mixcloud.com/musiclover1980/soichi-terada-essential-mix-2022-03-05/) from 2022. All of this merged together in my mind and I wondered if I could make a DJ mix? In 2024 surely there is software that can assist? There is.

## My first DJ mix

I pruned 50 tracks down to about 30 and set to work sequencing the tracks so their key and BPM flowed nicely. Each transition became a puzzle, gamifying the whole process. I had been listening to a loosely arranged playlist of 26 tracks for about a week, and two of those didn't make the cut for the final mix.

It was possible for me to create my first ever DJ mix thanks to some fantastic called [DJ.Studio](https://dj.studio) that makes light work of some difficult and cumbersome process. [Listen on MixCloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/gingerbeardman/2024/).

24 tracks with a duration of 1h18m58s, a mere 12 seconds longer than last year. Bonus points for consistency. It also meant I could run off some CDs and MiniDiscs for friends and acquaintances.
