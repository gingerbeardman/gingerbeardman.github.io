**I’m not one for traditional adventure games - ones with a long, drawn-out main quest, lots of optional sub quests, experience points, levelling up, random battles and all of that sort of stuff. I need more direction in what to do next, although I still want to have fun figuring out how to do it and on the journey getting there.**

My first _Zelda_ experience was playing [A Link to the Past](http://www.mobygames.com/game/legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past) on my SNES. It’s a great game and it has some clever touches throughout the story. But I can’t remember finishing it. That, in a nutshell, is my problem with _The Legend of Zelda_ series - although it took a while for me to realise, mainly because of _The Wind Waker_. Whilst it’s your typical _Zelda_ game, it looks so different to any of the previous games in the series with its cell-shaded graphical style that’s more akin to a Disney animation than a video game. The graphics alone meant I could put up with the annoyances the series had become bogged down with - the needless backtracking and relentless dungeon crawling. I know those things epitomise _Zelda_ but _The Wind Waker_ made me forget about them - for the better. It coated all that boring _Zelda_ stuff in visuals to die for - visuals that would make many movie animators slack jawed. And that was enough to see me through to the final credits.

Just prior to playing _The Wind Waker_ I’d read _Paulo Coelho’s_ [The Alchemist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)) which is a beautiful novel about realising your dreams. The book moved me a great deal and I never hesitate to recommend it. Whilst playing _The Wind Waker_ it struck me that there are a number of parallels between it and _The Alchemist_, and whilst I’d love to see a video game - or movie - based on The Alchemist, Nintendo had done enough to satiate my desire.

I’ve tried every _Zelda_ since and they’ve not held my attention as much as _The Wind Waker_. Only as recently as [The Twilight Princess](http://www.mobygames.com/game/legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess), with it’s more grown-up look, I decided that I’m pretty much wasting my time trying to find a Zelda game that hits me quite as hard as _The Wind Waker_ did. But there’s a special place in my heart for this story and I look forward to playing the game through again in 1080p High Definition when Nintendo give us capable hardware. I trust even more glorious visuals will once again help me see the final credits.
