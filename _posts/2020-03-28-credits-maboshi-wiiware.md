One of the best (according to [MetaCritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/maboshis-arcade), and [IMHO](https://dreampast.tumblr.com/post/1342575347/maboshi)) Wii games is a WiiWare game called MaBoShi that is now mostly lost to time in that Nintendo have closed the Wii Shop Channel. Of course, there are other more nefarious means to procure the game, but I'm not going to go into those here.

Anyway, I still play this game regularly (still not managed 1Million on Wii but have on the DS download version) and recently unlocked the Staff Credits (Staff Roll). My [submission to MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/wii/maboshis-arcade/credits) has just been approved, but I thought I'd mirror/announce them here.

## Postscript

Wii over VGA at 640x480 is totally amazing if you've not tried it. If you've always thought that the Wii's video output could never be great I implore you to try it! Check out how I do it [over at Retro Game Boards](https://www.retrogameboards.com/t/using-hdmi-to-vga-adapters-on-modern-consoles/1826/14?u=matt).
