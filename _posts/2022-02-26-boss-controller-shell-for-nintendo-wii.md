If you don't know already, I am of the opinion that the Nintendo Wii is the greatest console of all time and host to the greatest collection of games of all time. My Wii was a gift for my 30th Birthday, and still play games on it regularly to this day. 

I also have a love for odd controllers. On one of my searches for alternative classic controllers I found this beauty: the BOSS (Big Oversized Super Shell) by PDP. I love everything about it, from the forced acronym of its name to the colour schemes echoing famous Nintendo character colours.
