I often browse old Japanese console and computer magazines. I'm mainly searching for old [Hanafuda Koi-Koi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafuda) video games, but sometimes I stumble across something else that is interesting in a totally different way. 

Recently, whilst browsing an old issue of [POPCOM](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ポプコム) over at the wonderful Internet Archive, I found a period map of the [Akihabara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara) 秋葉原 district — famous for its multitude of stores selling electronics, video games and other otaku goods. 

I shared the map on Twitter, where it was well received, so I decided to go into this a bit more deeply here. Every so often I add any maps I find and there are now over 20 covering almost every year throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

[Get in touch](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman) if you have a map of Akihabara from the missing years. The Japanese あきはばら地図 or 秋葉原マップ mean "Akihabara map".

> **Further reading in Japanese:** there's a [great article at NIKKEI](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO76881870Q4A910C1000000/) that's well worth a read. If you want something heavier, there's [a blog post with history of the area](http://blog.livedoor.jp/mouseunit/archives/55039621.html) and its name change.

### 1976

The November 1976 issue of I/O magazine included a map of Akihabara which at this point was mostly radio electronics shops, with only very early signs of DIY computers.

Two maps can be seen in the combined book of issues from 1976 and 1977 that is available at Internet Archive. Hurrah!

## 1981

> **Missing:** a map was featured in だからいまマイコン　東大マイコンクラブ著　集英社 1981年 "So now Microcomputer" by the University of Tokyo Microcomputer Club, Shueisha, 1981. [Amazon Japan link](https://www.amazon.co.jp/だからいまマイコン-1981年/dp/B000J7SD6W).

----

### 1982

> **Missing:** another [one from 1982 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gds2546/status/956432325155237888), if I'm reading correctly it's from an issue of Micom.

This is the earliest map that shows the transition to computers, discovered in a [scan of Technopolis magazine on the internet archive dated November 1982](https://archive.org/details/technopolis-volume-4-november-1982/page/101/mode/2up?view=theater). Given its illustrated nature the map is somewhat stylised but the landmarks are easily recognised.

----

### 1983

A map was included with the January 1983 issue of Micom BASIC magazine. The below image is saved from a [Yahoo! Japan Auction listing](https://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/x1060034656).

[![Akihabara, January 1983](/images/posts/akihabara-1983-micom.jpg)](/images/posts/akihabara-1983-micom.jpg)

The version of the [POPCOM 1983-05](https://archive.org/details/POPCOM198305/page/n73) map shown below is a 12.5 megapixel high-resolution version that is much easier to read, made by stitching together the two highest resolution scans of these pages. Download _akiba-1983_ below.

Note: in the magazine the map is followed by 4 pages of listings that refer to the map using the A/J–1/10 key along its edge just in case you want to look some things up.

## 1984

This one from I/O 1984 May issue was found through [Google](http://hirax.net/diaryweb/2010/06/15.html) and [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20140810174816/http://hirax.net/diaryweb/2010/06/15.html), and I was lucky enough to be able to find matching scans on from Internet Archive.

## 1985

> **Missing:** Weekly GENDAI 週刊現代 featured a map in issue 206, 13th July 1985. [Auction link](https://page.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/1067115599) and [image here](/images/posts/akihabara-1985-gendai.jpg).

This one [I found referenced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoshinokentarou/status/1578567956249706496), a lovely map from the April 1985 issue of POPCOM (complete with cover artwork by Hiroshi Okamoto)

## 1987

I found one mentioned in a 1987 issue of Be-VAP　ビ・バップ. [Auction archive is here](https://aucview.com/yahoo/k406890612/) and [incomplete image is here](/images/posts/akihabara-1987-be-vap.jpg).

[One from 1987 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gantaro_junker/status/956173893730889735). This one I have tracked down as being from [ラジオ技術　1987年6月号](https://junkmouse.net/product/ラジオ技術%E3%80%801987年6月号/) the June 1987 issue of Radio Technology.

## 1988

> **Missing:** I found one on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QBi389/status/1556213046993108993) from a 1988 issue of ぴあ "Pia" magazine, but so far I've been unable to find scans of it.

This one from Google, but thankfully also present on Internet Archive. From I/O アイ・オー 1988年07月号 the July 1988 issue of I/O magazine.

## 1991

Through Google I found a map featured in "AK gazette" from Winter 1991.

## 1994

A partial map is featured in [this article by NIKKEI](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO76881870Q4A910C1000000/) which details the history of Akihabara and the phases of changes that happened throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

----

## 1995

There are three really cool maps in ゲームウララ Vol.1より Game Urara Vol. 1 featuring PC, video game and food/ammenities.

* [https://archive.org/details/gameurara-vol1-1995-600DPI/Game%20Urara%20-%20Vol.%201%20%28Searchable%29/page/n101/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/gameurara-vol1-1995-600DPI/Game%20Urara%20-%20Vol.%201%20%28Searchable%29/page/n101/mode/2up)

### 1996

Whilst searching my ever-growing archive of [Japanese Macintosh Media](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/mmm/) I found  an archived copy of the [Akiba organisation](https://www.akiba.or.jp) website on the Nikkei MAC CD Vol. 9, from 1997-02-15.

「ボーナスは大切にネ！!　秋葉原を上手に歩こう」 ("Take care of your bonus! Walk well in Akihabara.") is a copy of the Akiba website dated June 1996, some four months before [the earliest version in the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/19961029015522/http://www.akiba.or.jp/). A lot of the files that comprise the website are dated 1993, which I assume is when the site was first created. This sort of hand-built site really brings back some fond memories of the websites I built in the mid-90s: image maps, optimised GIFs, no content management system. Ah! The good old days.

The 250+ maps it contains are hyperlinked in a multitude of ways and the website navigates quite well considering its age. I've had most luck browsing using Netscape Navigator 3.01 (ja). The whole thing is quite comprehensive: maps are split into geographical zones and are detailed to a building floor level. Alternative lists by category and product type are also included. There are a total of 221 stores, of which 68 are member stores and receive more in-depth coverage with their own page and photos.

[![PNG](/images/posts/akihabara-1996.png)](/images/posts/akihabara-1996.png)

Another [one from 1996 via Google](http://misoji-no-wakaremiti.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2012/08/201208171995-fe.html), which was featured in the 「ASCII-DATES 1996」 notebook.

### 1998

This new discovery reminded me of another vintage map of Akihabara that I had seen recently, only this time it was digital and available for platforms that were popular at the time: Palm OS (as a native app), Macintosh and Windows (as a FileMaker Pro interactive database).

[![PNG](/images/posts/akihabara-1998.png)](/images/posts/akihabara-1998.png)

I've attached two versions of the Palm OS app below, _akiba500_ (c.2000) and _akiba507_ (c.2001).

All versions of these interactive maps can be downloaded at the following links:

*   [https://web.archive.org/web/19981202125237/http://www.dogcow.com/akibamap/index.html](https://web.archive.org/web/19981202125237/http://www.dogcow.com/akibamap/index.html)
*   [https://www.vector.co.jp/vpack/browse/person/an009155.html](https://www.vector.co.jp/vpack/browse/person/an009155.html)

I think of this map as the _DogCow Map_ due to the domain it was hosted on at the time, but its official name is _Kosapi's Akiba Map_ 「こさぴーの秋葉マップ」named after the group of fans that created and curated it by documenting their trips to Akihabara.

### 2000

> **Missing:** around this time you could buy the 秋葉原攻略ハンドブック Akihabara Strategy Handbook which included comprehensive maps and shop guides across hundreds of pages.

The HTML version was typical of websites at the time: way too many _HTML_ files and _images_ with _image-maps_ presented as a _frameset_ that makes specific pages pretty much impossible to bookmark. Ah, the heady days of Y2K web development! 

Download _akibaweb2kr1_ below, or from the following [archive.org](https://archive.org) link.

*   [http://web.archive.org/web/20050212144103/http://homepage1.nifty.com/akiba/akibaweb2kr1.zip](https://web.archive.org/web/20050212144103/http://homepage1.nifty.com/akiba/akibaweb2kr1.zip)

### 2001

The digital download versions of Kosapi's Akiba Map were updated until around 2001, when I guess easy access to the internet made offline maps like this somewhat less useful.

But the FileMaker Pro database is interesting, as it can still be loaded and viewed on modern macOS. When I loaded it into FileMaker Pro 11 — a vintage Trial version from 2010 that _just about_ manages to run on macOS 10.13.6 — the database was converted to a more modern format that I've attached to this post (download _akibamapti.fp7_ below). You can click around hyperlinks to navigate and view business details in a very CD-ROM kind of way. 

Anyway, I did a bunch of image grabbing and assembling to put together this large 27.8 megapixel version of the map (download _akiba-2001_ below):

### 1999–2009

For 10 years, an interactive online map was published by Impress Corporation under the title of _AKIBA PC Hotline!_ It's similar to _Kosapi's Akiba Map_ and arguably better made.

### More?

I'll be sure to add to this post if any other interesting vintage maps of Akihbara come to light. Especially for the years we're currently missing maps.
