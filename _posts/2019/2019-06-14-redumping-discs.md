Redump is a Disc Preservation Project that requires multiple verified dumps of the same game disc before it is marked as good. It's a worthy endeavour that secures the future for disc-based games. Their data is public and downloadable, and I've heard that the game data is available at archive.org.

To get involved with such dumping and verification, you'll need:

- a compatible disc drive/reader (mine is a Plextor PX-716UF)
- some free/open-source software (and a Windows install)
- time (most discs take a quite a few minutes)

I started out dumping my rarest discs, some titles for the ill-fated NUON system. More recently I've been dumping my collection of obscure Japanese PS1 games, amongst others.

You can check out my dumps so far at [redump.org/discs/dumper/gingerbeardman/](http://redump.org/discs/dumper/gingerbeardman/)
