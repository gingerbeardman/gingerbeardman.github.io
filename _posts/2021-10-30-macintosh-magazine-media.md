For a while now I've been collecting CD-ROMs and Floppy Disks that came with Japanese Macintosh magazines for the sake of preservation of classic Macintosh software and games.

These magazines were released before widespread adoption of the internet, when it was tricky to discover new software and even more difficult to obtain it. Buying a magazine with a disc containing hundreds or sometimes thousands of files was an easy way of getting the latest software. Of course, more than twenty years have now passed and software that was once common has all but disappeared. These magazine discs provide time capsules inside which live many long forgotten secrets.

The archive as it stands (October 2022):

*   date range: 1991–2002
*   total media: 378
*   total files: 841,491

This is such an amazing treasure trove of files, containing many long lost files of both English and Japanese origin. The scatter chart shows the range of date coverage of the collection, and full file listings are searchable at [https://www.gingerbeardman.com/mmm/](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/mmm/)

## Notable finds so far

*   [Emora Kart](https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2021/10/31/mouse-controlled-super-mario-kart-clone-for-classic-macintosh/) from 1994 (previously three google search results)
*   [Hanafuda Stack](https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2021/10/31/hypercard-hanafuda/) from 1992/3 (previously zero google search results)
*   Fans of _Macromedia Shockwave_ and _Osamu Sato_ uncovered a 1997/8 [demo of Roly-Polys World Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlMzJs8Eb8Y) which is hugely exciting as the complete game remains lost to time

*   [JapanEase](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/japanease) rolling demos of two gorgeous language learning HyperCard decks from the early 1990s (one previously lost)

*   [MacCalligraphy Sansui Demo](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/maccalligraphy-sansui), version of Japanese calligraphy tool from 1999 (previously lost) I also uncovered a promotional leaflet and demo guide from Wayback Machine

My [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gingerbeardman) enables me to buy more discs to build out the database, finding more lost gems and sharing them once again with the world. I add missing discs to _Internet Archive_ and the _redump_ project and upload individual games to various Classic Macintosh archives.

Thanks for being on this journey with me!
