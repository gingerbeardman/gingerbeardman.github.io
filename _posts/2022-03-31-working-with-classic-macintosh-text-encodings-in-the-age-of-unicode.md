One of my "lockdown projects" is a collection of media from vintage Japanese Apple Macintosh magazines. These are mostly CD-ROMs but there are some floppy disks too. I started the project in July 2021 and have so far collected an archive of over 250 items spanning just over a decade, uncovering many long lost classics in the process. I call the project [Macintosh Magazine Media](https://www.patreon.com/posts/58097660) and contributions are always welcome.

## The Relentless March of Progress

Accessing vintage Macintosh media from the "classic" era is more difficult than it should be. This is largely due to Apple removing support for accessing the HFS Standard format in modern macOS, since Catalina. My guess is that the code that implemented that support was 32-bit code and the move to 64-bit only in preparation of Apple Silicon meant it would have to be rewritten so instead they removed it completely. You can still access HFS Standard disks in Mojave, but there are still problems when exotic text encodings are used.

## Before Unicode

Classic Macintosh was created in a world before the world moved to Unicode. But of course many languages existed and people speaking those languages wanted to use Macintosh computers. So Apple were forced to provide support for those languages. They did so by offering their system software in multiple languages. If you think of how embedded Unicode is in our software today, it was the same sort of thing: only repeated for each individual language!

For European, Western, or Latin-based languages you'd be forgiven for not noticing the differences as most of the characters are the same. The problem comes with non-Latin languages, like Japanese.

## Opening Pandora's Box

I figured out quickly that the only way of viewing the contents of media containing Japanese files correctly was to use a Japanese version of Macintosh system software. It sounds obvious in hindsight but it was not at the time! Seeing as I prefer System 7 to later versions I installed System J-7.5.3 in the BasiliskII emulator alongside my existing systems so I can switch to it on demand. Emulation makes the whole thing so much easier by removing the friction of old, slow hardware.

There are many apps capable of cataloguing removable media, but it took me a long time to find one that could cope with Japanese. I learned an important lesson here: if you're dealing with Japanese look for apps made in Japan! More on that later. [DiskCatalogMaker](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/diskcatalogmaker) (formerly DiskChoboMaker) was the cataloguing app that I finally found that worked well enough for my needs. In fact, it's still being updated today which and can even import files created with older versions so I can copy my database from classic Mac OS to modern macOS and "it just works" if you do so with macOS set to Japanese locale. But as good as DiskCatalogMaker is it still has problems with some filenames that results in missing entries, it uses a proprietary database format, and it has cumbersome way of exporting listings that does not support bulk operations. I scripted an automated export solution using [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) but that was slow and tedious to do whenever there were catalogue changes or additions.

## DIY

With no better solutions to be found the only remaining choice was to do it myself. This was in October 2021.

I found two apps that can be used on modern systems to view HFS media, both of which seemed like good places to start rather than reinventing the wheel:
- [HFSExplorer](https://github.com/unsound/hfsexplorer) - a Java GUI app
- [hfsutils](https://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/hfs/) - a command-line suite of tools

## HFSExplorer

This app opened a lot of my HFS media, but failed on others. I [filed an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/unsound/hfsexplorer/issues/15) and to my surprise it was quickly resolved. This led to the discovery that the filenames on the media were in MacJapanese text encoding, so that was also added to HFSExplorer. Things went well for a while until certain other media failed to be read completely. Characters in certain filenames were out-of-range for MacJapanese. A [workaround](https://github.com/unsound/hfsexplorer/issues/26) was to read the filenames as MacJapanese and drop down to MacRoman for any filenames with out-of-range characters. This worked well enough.


At this point my attention moved on to wanting to search the contents of all media. It was possible with DiskCatalogMaker but I was limited to using apps on classic Macintosh or modern macOS. Ideally I'd want the search to be web based. So I needed to generate text file listings of each disk. This was the end of the line for HFSExplorer for me, as I found no easy way of doing so.

## Aside: out-of-range characters

You might be wondering: how can there be out of range characters and what are they? There are a few scenarios that cause these problem characters to appear in filenames:
1. Files encoded as MacRoman or Shift-JIS originating on other systems can easily be copied onto a computer running MacJapanese but the filenames are not re-encoded.
2. Pressing forward delete key on an extended keyboard whilst renaming a file inserts an invisible DEL character into the filename rather than doing any actual deleting!

## hfsutils

Next, `hfsutils`. It's trivial to export the contents of a disk image as a text file, using the command line tool `hls`, but I couldn't make sense of the contents. I had no luck with the best text editors on classic Mac OS: BBEdit, Nisus, Tex-Edit Plus, even Japanese apps like LightWayText couldn't deal with the text. I had a little luck with a classic app called Cyclone Classic, but it hit the same problem as HFSExplorer when coming up against out-of-range characters.

The modern tool `iconv` couldn't deal with the listings as it has no support for MacJapanese. I could get by processing as Shift-JIS and forcing unsupported characters to be ignored. But it wasn't a good enough solution: MacJapanese is not Shift-JIS.

Thinking back to using Japanese apps to work with Japanese text I looked for any modern Japanese text editors for macOS. There are a handful and I eventually stumbled across a modern Japanese text editor called [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com) which handles old Macintosh text files with aplomb. This app is now my default text file viewer and it comes highly recommended. It can't be my work editor as it unfortunately doesn't support opening folders or projects of multiple files. It still has problems with my directory listings but at least it's a modern way to view the majority of Japanese text files.

At this point, I was at an impasse and couldn't think of any way to proceed. Eventually I had a couple of breakthroughs.

## ScummVM

What on earth does a point-and-click video game engine have to do with text encoding? Well it turns out that in July 2021 at the same time I was trying to solve this problem so where the ScummVM team. They needed a tool to be able to handle Japanese media that contained games that run on their engine and so created [dumper-companion](https://github.com/einstein95/scummvm/blob/master/devtools/dumper-companion.py). It was a pretty good solution once it had [support for MacJapanese added](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/pull/3485) in the same way it had been for HFSExplorer. But it was far too slow, reading the whole disk into memory at once, and it still had problems with the out-of-range characters.

## Tickle

From time to time I would search for possible ways to deal with MacJapanese encoding. One day in November 2021 I stumbled on Tcl (pronounced "tickle") which has support for a whole bunch of text encodings, including MacJapanese! What's more [the encoding maps were written by Apple](https://opensource.apple.com/source/tcl/tcl-10/tcl/tools/encoding/macJapan.txt) in the mid-90s, so it's likely to be as correct as can be. Note: Peter Edberg, who wrote the Tcl mappings, is still working at Apple after almost 35 years!

The Tcl solution to convert from MacJapanese to Unicode is a one-liner:

    puts out.txt [encoding convertfrom macJapan [read in.txt]]

So much effort to arrive at this simple solution!

## conver2unicode

I wrapped the Tcl one-liner in a bunch more script so that it can handle both files and directories, as well as wildcards and stdin. It can also list all known encodings, and can take an argument representing the source encoding (of course it defaults to MacJapanese). I made the one-liner into a proper command-line tool.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/gingerbeardman/4a3b66236e018b72b32ca17953474e12.js"></script>

I have a shell script that runs `convert2unicode` against my drive full of disk images and takes less than 30 seconds to produce catalogue text files for 250 items.

## Let there be search

So, at this point I can generate text files with the contents of each disk, but to get sensible search results each filename would have to have its full path. So I [forked hfsutils and added a "full" mode](https://github.com/gingerbeardman/hfsutils) to display the listing in just the way I wanted. My C skills were really rusty so this was a bit of a challenge.

I created a rudimentary [web-based search engine](https://www.gingerbeardman.com/mmm/) that is powered by `rg` (`ripgrep`, a variant `grep`) and can search through hundreds of files totalling almost half a million lines in a fraction of a second.

## Future

I'd like to offer the ability for individual files to be extracted from a disk image so they can be downloaded by interested parties. This would be similar to the way Internet Archive allows individual files to be downloaded from inside ISO disk images. However, this involves further challenges with text encoding and I would also have to address potential bandwidth concerns.

Whilst the Tcl solution is great, it is not quite perfect. Currently the behaviour of the `encoding convertfrom` command silently ignores problem characters. [Future versions of Tcl will have the option of displaying errors](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/info/535705ffffffffff). I'll keep an eye on that progress and upgrade my scripts when the time comes.
