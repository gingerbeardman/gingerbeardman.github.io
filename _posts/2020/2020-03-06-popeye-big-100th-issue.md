This is a special 100th issue of POPEYE a Japanese lifestyle "Magazine for City Boys": [archive.org/details/popeye-magazine-for-city-boys-1981-04-10/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/popeye-magazine-for-city-boys-1981-04-10/mode/2up)

Only very minor game related things in this, but I thought it worth posting. There's a Game & Watch as a selectable reward/prize in a competition by Puma. Plus a "how to" for Hanafuda (the reason I bought the issue) and reviews of various physical card games. Plus lots more besides!

If you don't have time to flick through 276 pages, then I created a twitter thread that summarises the most interesting stuff: [twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/1235585813137756161](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman/status/1235585813137756161)
