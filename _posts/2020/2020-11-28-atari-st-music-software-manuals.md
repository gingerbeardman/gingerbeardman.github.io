I scanned these a while ago, but dealing with a troll in an online Atari ST community made me forget about them for a while. Not out of spite, but more because I don't have time for toxic people so I just dropped what I was doing and changed direction when I encountered this particular person. Remember: be excellent to each other! Be nice.

Anyway! Three manuals were scanned from my ring binder hard copies, as always they are uploaded to Internet Archive as Searchable PDFs:

*   [Cubeat 2.0](https://archive.org/details/cubeat-2-manual-for-atari-st) (338 pages)
*   [Notator Alpha 1.1](https://archive.org/details/notator-alpha-manual-atari-st) (258 pages)
*   [Notator SL/Creator SL 3.1](https://archive.org/details/notator-sl-creator-sl-manual-atari-st) (770 pages)

Plus a disk image and zip of the relatively rare Cubeat 2.0:
